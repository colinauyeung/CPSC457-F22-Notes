ACT I
SCENE I. King Lear's palace.

    Enter KENT, GLOUCESTER, and EDMUND 

KENT

    I thought the king had more affected the Duke of
    Albany than Cornwall.

GLOUCESTER

    It did always seem so to us: but now, in the
    division of the kingdom, it appears not which of
    the dukes he values most; for equalities are so
    weighed, that curiosity in neither can make choice
    of either's moiety.

KENT

    Is not this your son, my lord?

GLOUCESTER

    His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have
    so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am
    brazed to it.

KENT

    I cannot conceive you.

GLOUCESTER

    Sir, this young fellow's mother could: whereupon
    she grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a son
    for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed.
    Do you smell a fault?

KENT

    I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it
    being so proper.

GLOUCESTER

    But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year
    elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account:
    though this knave came something saucily into the
    world before he was sent for, yet was his mother
    fair; there was good sport at his making, and the
    whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this
    noble gentleman, Edmund?

EDMUND

    No, my lord.

GLOUCESTER

    My lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my
    honourable friend.

EDMUND

    My services to your lordship.

KENT

    I must love you, and sue to know you better.

EDMUND

    Sir, I shall study deserving.

GLOUCESTER

    He hath been out nine years, and away he shall
    again. The king is coming.

    Sennet. Enter KING LEAR, CORNWALL, ALBANY, GONERIL, REGAN, CORDELIA, and Attendants

KING LEAR

    Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.

GLOUCESTER

    I shall, my liege.

    Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EDMUND

KING LEAR

    Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.
    Give me the map there. Know that we have divided
    In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent
    To shake all cares and business from our age;
    Conferring them on younger strengths, while we
    Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,
    And you, our no less loving son of Albany,
    We have this hour a constant will to publish
    Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife
    May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,
    Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,
    Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,
    And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters,--
    Since now we will divest us both of rule,
    Interest of territory, cares of state,--
    Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
    That we our largest bounty may extend
    Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,
    Our eldest-born, speak first.

GONERIL

    Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;
    Dearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty;
    Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;
    No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;
    As much as child e'er loved, or father found;
    A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable;
    Beyond all manner of so much I love you.

CORDELIA

    [Aside] What shall Cordelia do?
    Love, and be silent.

LEAR

    Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,
    With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,
    With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,
    We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issue
    Be this perpetual. What says our second daughter,
    Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.

REGAN

    Sir, I am made
    Of the self-same metal that my sister is,
    And prize me at her worth. In my true heart
    I find she names my very deed of love;
    Only she comes too short: that I profess
    Myself an enemy to all other joys,
    Which the most precious square of sense possesses;
    And find I am alone felicitate
    In your dear highness' love.

CORDELIA

    [Aside] Then poor Cordelia!
    And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love's
    More richer than my tongue.

KING LEAR

    To thee and thine hereditary ever
    Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom;
    No less in space, validity, and pleasure,
    Than that conferr'd on Goneril. Now, our joy,
    Although the last, not least; to whose young love
    The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
    Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw
    A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.

CORDELIA

    Nothing, my lord.

KING LEAR

    Nothing!

CORDELIA

    Nothing.

KING LEAR

    Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.

CORDELIA

    Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
    My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty
    According to my bond; nor more nor less.

KING LEAR

    How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little,
    Lest it may mar your fortunes.

CORDELIA

    Good my lord,
    You have begot me, bred me, loved me: I
    Return those duties back as are right fit,
    Obey you, love you, and most honour you.
    Why have my sisters husbands, if they say
    They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,
    That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
    Half my love with him, half my care and duty:
    Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters,
    To love my father all.

KING LEAR

    But goes thy heart with this?

CORDELIA

    Ay, good my lord.

KING LEAR

    So young, and so untender?

CORDELIA

    So young, my lord, and true.

KING LEAR

    Let it be so; thy truth, then, be thy dower:
    For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,
    The mysteries of Hecate, and the night;
    By all the operation of the orbs
    From whom we do exist, and cease to be;
    Here I disclaim all my paternal care,
    Propinquity and property of blood,
    And as a stranger to my heart and me
    Hold thee, from this, for ever. The barbarous Scythian,
    Or he that makes his generation messes
    To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom
    Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and relieved,
    As thou my sometime daughter.

KENT

    Good my liege,--

KING LEAR

    Peace, Kent!
    Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
    I loved her most, and thought to set my rest
    On her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight!
    So be my grave my peace, as here I give
    Her father's heart from her! Call France; who stirs?
    Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,
    With my two daughters' dowers digest this third:
    Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.
    I do invest you jointly with my power,
    Pre-eminence, and all the large effects
    That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,
    With reservation of an hundred knights,
    By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode
    Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain
    The name, and all the additions to a king;
    The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,
    Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,
    This coronet part betwixt you.

    Giving the crown

KENT

    Royal Lear,
    Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,
    Loved as my father, as my master follow'd,
    As my great patron thought on in my prayers,--

KING LEAR

    The bow is bent and drawn, make from the shaft.

KENT

    Let it fall rather, though the fork invade
    The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly,
    When Lear is mad. What wilt thou do, old man?
    Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,
    When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound,
    When majesty stoops to folly. Reverse thy doom;
    And, in thy best consideration, cheque
    This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment,
    Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;
    Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound
    Reverbs no hollowness.

KING LEAR

    Kent, on thy life, no more.

KENT

    My life I never held but as a pawn
    To wage against thy enemies; nor fear to lose it,
    Thy safety being the motive.

KING LEAR

    Out of my sight!

KENT

    See better, Lear; and let me still remain
    The true blank of thine eye.

KING LEAR

    Now, by Apollo,--

KENT

    Now, by Apollo, king,
    Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.

KING LEAR

    O, vassal! miscreant!

    Laying his hand on his sword

ALBANY CORNWALL

    Dear sir, forbear.

KENT

    Do:
    Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow
    Upon thy foul disease. Revoke thy doom;
    Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,
    I'll tell thee thou dost evil.

KING LEAR

    Hear me, recreant!
    On thine allegiance, hear me!
    Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow,
    Which we durst never yet, and with strain'd pride
    To come between our sentence and our power,
    Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,
    Our potency made good, take thy reward.
    Five days we do allot thee, for provision
    To shield thee from diseases of the world;
    And on the sixth to turn thy hated back
    Upon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following,
    Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,
    The moment is thy death. Away! by Jupiter,
    This shall not be revoked.

KENT

    Fare thee well, king: sith thus thou wilt appear,
    Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.

    To CORDELIA
    The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,
    That justly think'st, and hast most rightly said!

    To REGAN and GONERIL
    And your large speeches may your deeds approve,
    That good effects may spring from words of love.
    Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;
    He'll shape his old course in a country new.

    Exit

    Flourish. Re-enter GLOUCESTER, with KING OF FRANCE, BURGUNDY, and Attendants

GLOUCESTER

    Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.

KING LEAR

    My lord of Burgundy.
    We first address towards you, who with this king
    Hath rivall'd for our daughter: what, in the least,
    Will you require in present dower with her,
    Or cease your quest of love?

BURGUNDY

    Most royal majesty,
    I crave no more than what your highness offer'd,
    Nor will you tender less.

KING LEAR

    Right noble Burgundy,
    When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;
    But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands:
    If aught within that little seeming substance,
    Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced,
    And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,
    She's there, and she is yours.

BURGUNDY

    I know no answer.

KING LEAR

    Will you, with those infirmities she owes,
    Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,
    Dower'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,
    Take her, or leave her?

BURGUNDY

    Pardon me, royal sir;
    Election makes not up on such conditions.

KING LEAR

    Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,
    I tell you all her wealth.

    To KING OF FRANCE
    For you, great king,
    I would not from your love make such a stray,
    To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you
    To avert your liking a more worthier way
    Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed
    Almost to acknowledge hers.

KING OF FRANCE

    This is most strange,
    That she, that even but now was your best object,
    The argument of your praise, balm of your age,
    Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time
    Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle
    So many folds of favour. Sure, her offence
    Must be of such unnatural degree,
    That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection
    Fall'n into taint: which to believe of her,
    Must be a faith that reason without miracle
    Could never plant in me.

CORDELIA

    I yet beseech your majesty,--
    If for I want that glib and oily art,
    To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,
    I'll do't before I speak,--that you make known
    It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,
    No unchaste action, or dishonour'd step,
    That hath deprived me of your grace and favour;
    But even for want of that for which I am richer,
    A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
    As I am glad I have not, though not to have it
    Hath lost me in your liking.

KING LEAR

    Better thou
    Hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better.

KING OF FRANCE

    Is it but this,--a tardiness in nature
    Which often leaves the history unspoke
    That it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy,
    What say you to the lady? Love's not love
    When it is mingled with regards that stand
    Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her?
    She is herself a dowry.

BURGUNDY

    Royal Lear,
    Give but that portion which yourself proposed,
    And here I take Cordelia by the hand,
    Duchess of Burgundy.

KING LEAR

    Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.

BURGUNDY

    I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father
    That you must lose a husband.

CORDELIA

    Peace be with Burgundy!
    Since that respects of fortune are his love,
    I shall not be his wife.

KING OF FRANCE

    Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;
    Most choice, forsaken; and most loved, despised!
    Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon:
    Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.
    Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect
    My love should kindle to inflamed respect.
    Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,
    Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:
    Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy
    Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.
    Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:
    Thou losest here, a better where to find.

KING LEAR

    Thou hast her, France: let her be thine; for we
    Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see
    That face of hers again. Therefore be gone
    Without our grace, our love, our benison.
    Come, noble Burgundy.

    Flourish. Exeunt all but KING OF FRANCE, GONERIL, REGAN, and CORDELIA

KING OF FRANCE

    Bid farewell to your sisters.

CORDELIA

    The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes
    Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;
    And like a sister am most loath to call
    Your faults as they are named. Use well our father:
    To your professed bosoms I commit him
    But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,
    I would prefer him to a better place.
    So, farewell to you both.

REGAN

    Prescribe not us our duties.

GONERIL

    Let your study
    Be to content your lord, who hath received you
    At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,
    And well are worth the want that you have wanted.

CORDELIA

    Time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides:
    Who cover faults, at last shame them derides.
    Well may you prosper!

KING OF FRANCE

    Come, my fair Cordelia.

    Exeunt KING OF FRANCE and CORDELIA

GONERIL

    Sister, it is not a little I have to say of what
    most nearly appertains to us both. I think our
    father will hence to-night.

REGAN

    That's most certain, and with you; next month with us.

GONERIL

    You see how full of changes his age is; the
    observation we have made of it hath not been
    little: he always loved our sister most; and
    with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off
    appears too grossly.

REGAN

    'Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever
    but slenderly known himself.

GONERIL

    The best and soundest of his time hath been but
    rash; then must we look to receive from his age,
    not alone the imperfections of long-engraffed
    condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness
    that infirm and choleric years bring with them.

REGAN

    Such unconstant starts are we like to have from
    him as this of Kent's banishment.

GONERIL

    There is further compliment of leavetaking
    between France and him. Pray you, let's hit
    together: if our father carry authority with
    such dispositions as he bears, this last
    surrender of his will but offend us.

REGAN

    We shall further think on't.

GONERIL

    We must do something, and i' the heat.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. The Earl of Gloucester's castle.

    Enter EDMUND, with a letter 

EDMUND

    Thou, nature, art my goddess; to thy law
    My services are bound. Wherefore should I
    Stand in the plague of custom, and permit
    The curiosity of nations to deprive me,
    For that I am some twelve or fourteen moon-shines
    Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?
    When my dimensions are as well compact,
    My mind as generous, and my shape as true,
    As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us
    With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?
    Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take
    More composition and fierce quality
    Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,
    Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops,
    Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well, then,
    Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land:
    Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund
    As to the legitimate: fine word,--legitimate!
    Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,
    And my invention thrive, Edmund the base
    Shall top the legitimate. I grow; I prosper:
    Now, gods, stand up for bastards!

    Enter GLOUCESTER

GLOUCESTER

    Kent banish'd thus! and France in choler parted!
    And the king gone to-night! subscribed his power!
    Confined to exhibition! All this done
    Upon the gad! Edmund, how now! what news?

EDMUND

    So please your lordship, none.

    Putting up the letter

GLOUCESTER

    Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?

EDMUND

    I know no news, my lord.

GLOUCESTER

    What paper were you reading?

EDMUND

    Nothing, my lord.

GLOUCESTER

    No? What needed, then, that terrible dispatch of
    it into your pocket? the quality of nothing hath
    not such need to hide itself. Let's see: come,
    if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.

EDMUND

    I beseech you, sir, pardon me: it is a letter
    from my brother, that I have not all o'er-read;
    and for so much as I have perused, I find it not
    fit for your o'er-looking.

GLOUCESTER

    Give me the letter, sir.

EDMUND

    I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The
    contents, as in part I understand them, are to blame.

GLOUCESTER

    Let's see, let's see.

EDMUND

    I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote
    this but as an essay or taste of my virtue.

GLOUCESTER

    [Reads] 'This policy and reverence of age makes
    the world bitter to the best of our times; keeps
    our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish
    them. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage
    in the oppression of aged tyranny; who sways, not
    as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to
    me, that of this I may speak more. If our father
    would sleep till I waked him, you should half his
    revenue for ever, and live the beloved of your
    brother, EDGAR.'
    Hum--conspiracy!--'Sleep till I waked him,--you
    should enjoy half his revenue,'--My son Edgar!
    Had he a hand to write this? a heart and brain
    to breed it in?--When came this to you? who
    brought it?

EDMUND

    It was not brought me, my lord; there's the
    cunning of it; I found it thrown in at the
    casement of my closet.

GLOUCESTER

    You know the character to be your brother's?

EDMUND

    If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear
    it were his; but, in respect of that, I would
    fain think it were not.

GLOUCESTER

    It is his.

EDMUND

    It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is
    not in the contents.

GLOUCESTER

    Hath he never heretofore sounded you in this business?

EDMUND

    Never, my lord: but I have heard him oft
    maintain it to be fit, that, sons at perfect age,
    and fathers declining, the father should be as
    ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.

GLOUCESTER

    O villain, villain! His very opinion in the
    letter! Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested,
    brutish villain! worse than brutish! Go, sirrah,
    seek him; I'll apprehend him: abominable villain!
    Where is he?

EDMUND

    I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please
    you to suspend your indignation against my
    brother till you can derive from him better
    testimony of his intent, you shall run a certain
    course; where, if you violently proceed against
    him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great
    gap in your own honour, and shake in pieces the
    heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life
    for him, that he hath wrote this to feel my
    affection to your honour, and to no further
    pretence of danger.

GLOUCESTER

    Think you so?

EDMUND

    If your honour judge it meet, I will place you
    where you shall hear us confer of this, and by an
    auricular assurance have your satisfaction; and
    that without any further delay than this very evening.

GLOUCESTER

    He cannot be such a monster--

EDMUND

    Nor is not, sure.

GLOUCESTER

    To his father, that so tenderly and entirely
    loves him. Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him
    out: wind me into him, I pray you: frame the
    business after your own wisdom. I would unstate
    myself, to be in a due resolution.

EDMUND

    I will seek him, sir, presently: convey the
    business as I shall find means and acquaint you withal.

GLOUCESTER

    These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend
    no good to us: though the wisdom of nature can
    reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself
    scourged by the sequent effects: love cools,
    friendship falls off, brothers divide: in
    cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in
    palaces, treason; and the bond cracked 'twixt son
    and father. This villain of mine comes under the
    prediction; there's son against father: the king
    falls from bias of nature; there's father against
    child. We have seen the best of our time:
    machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all
    ruinous disorders, follow us disquietly to our
    graves. Find out this villain, Edmund; it shall
    lose thee nothing; do it carefully. And the
    noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his
    offence, honesty! 'Tis strange.

    Exit

EDMUND

    This is the excellent foppery of the world, that,
    when we are sick in fortune,--often the surfeit
    of our own behavior,--we make guilty of our
    disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars: as
    if we were villains by necessity; fools by
    heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and
    treachers, by spherical predominance; drunkards,
    liars, and adulterers, by an enforced obedience of
    planetary influence; and all that we are evil in,
    by a divine thrusting on: an admirable evasion
    of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish
    disposition to the charge of a star! My
    father compounded with my mother under the
    dragon's tail; and my nativity was under Ursa
    major; so that it follows, I am rough and
    lecherous. Tut, I should have been that I am,
    had the maidenliest star in the firmament
    twinkled on my bastardizing. Edgar--

    Enter EDGAR
    And pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old
    comedy: my cue is villanous melancholy, with a
    sigh like Tom o' Bedlam. O, these eclipses do
    portend these divisions! fa, sol, la, mi.

EDGAR

    How now, brother Edmund! what serious
    contemplation are you in?

EDMUND

    I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read
    this other day, what should follow these eclipses.

EDGAR

    Do you busy yourself about that?

EDMUND

    I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed
    unhappily; as of unnaturalness between the child
    and the parent; death, dearth, dissolutions of
    ancient amities; divisions in state, menaces and
    maledictions against king and nobles; needless
    diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation
    of cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not what.

EDGAR

    How long have you been a sectary astronomical?

EDMUND

    Come, come; when saw you my father last?

EDGAR

    Why, the night gone by.

EDMUND

    Spake you with him?

EDGAR

    Ay, two hours together.

EDMUND

    Parted you in good terms? Found you no
    displeasure in him by word or countenance?

EDGAR

    None at all.

EDMUND

    Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended
    him: and at my entreaty forbear his presence
    till some little time hath qualified the heat of
    his displeasure; which at this instant so rageth
    in him, that with the mischief of your person it
    would scarcely allay.

EDGAR

    Some villain hath done me wrong.

EDMUND

    That's my fear. I pray you, have a continent
    forbearance till the spied of his rage goes
    slower; and, as I say, retire with me to my
    lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to
    hear my lord speak: pray ye, go; there's my key:
    if you do stir abroad, go armed.

EDGAR

    Armed, brother!

EDMUND

    Brother, I advise you to the best; go armed: I
    am no honest man if there be any good meaning
    towards you: I have told you what I have seen
    and heard; but faintly, nothing like the image
    and horror of it: pray you, away.

EDGAR

    Shall I hear from you anon?

EDMUND

    I do serve you in this business.

    Exit EDGAR
    A credulous father! and a brother noble,
    Whose nature is so far from doing harms,
    That he suspects none: on whose foolish honesty
    My practises ride easy! I see the business.
    Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit:
    All with me's meet that I can fashion fit.

    Exit

SCENE III. The Duke of Albany's palace.

    Enter GONERIL, and OSWALD, her steward 

GONERIL

    Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool?

OSWALD

    Yes, madam.

GONERIL

    By day and night he wrongs me; every hour
    He flashes into one gross crime or other,
    That sets us all at odds: I'll not endure it:
    His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us
    On every trifle. When he returns from hunting,
    I will not speak with him; say I am sick:
    If you come slack of former services,
    You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer.

OSWALD

    He's coming, madam; I hear him.

    Horns within

GONERIL

    Put on what weary negligence you please,
    You and your fellows; I'll have it come to question:
    If he dislike it, let him to our sister,
    Whose mind and mine, I know, in that are one,
    Not to be over-ruled. Idle old man,
    That still would manage those authorities
    That he hath given away! Now, by my life,
    Old fools are babes again; and must be used
    With cheques as flatteries,--when they are seen abused.
    Remember what I tell you.

OSWALD

    Well, madam.

GONERIL

    And let his knights have colder looks among you;
    What grows of it, no matter; advise your fellows so:
    I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,
    That I may speak: I'll write straight to my sister,
    To hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. A hall in the same.

    Enter KENT, disguised 

KENT

    If but as well I other accents borrow,
    That can my speech defuse, my good intent
    May carry through itself to that full issue
    For which I razed my likeness. Now, banish'd Kent,
    If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn'd,
    So may it come, thy master, whom thou lovest,
    Shall find thee full of labours.

    Horns within. Enter KING LEAR, Knights, and Attendants

KING LEAR

    Let me not stay a jot for dinner; go get it ready.

    Exit an Attendant
    How now! what art thou?

KENT

    A man, sir.

KING LEAR

    What dost thou profess? what wouldst thou with us?

KENT

    I do profess to be no less than I seem; to serve
    him truly that will put me in trust: to love him
    that is honest; to converse with him that is wise,
    and says little; to fear judgment; to fight when I
    cannot choose; and to eat no fish.

KING LEAR

    What art thou?

KENT

    A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the king.

KING LEAR

    If thou be as poor for a subject as he is for a
    king, thou art poor enough. What wouldst thou?

KENT

    Service.

KING LEAR

    Who wouldst thou serve?

KENT

    You.

KING LEAR

    Dost thou know me, fellow?

KENT

    No, sir; but you have that in your countenance
    which I would fain call master.

KING LEAR

    What's that?

KENT

    Authority.

KING LEAR

    What services canst thou do?

KENT

    I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious
    tale in telling it, and deliver a plain message
    bluntly: that which ordinary men are fit for, I am
    qualified in; and the best of me is diligence.

KING LEAR

    How old art thou?

KENT

    Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor
    so old to dote on her for any thing: I have years
    on my back forty eight.

KING LEAR

    Follow me; thou shalt serve me: if I like thee no
    worse after dinner, I will not part from thee yet.
    Dinner, ho, dinner! Where's my knave? my fool?
    Go you, and call my fool hither.

    Exit an Attendant

    Enter OSWALD
    You, you, sirrah, where's my daughter?

OSWALD

    So please you,--

    Exit

KING LEAR

    What says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll back.

    Exit a Knight
    Where's my fool, ho? I think the world's asleep.

    Re-enter Knight
    How now! where's that mongrel?

Knight

    He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.

KING LEAR

    Why came not the slave back to me when I called him.

Knight

    Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would
    not.

KING LEAR

    He would not!

Knight

    My lord, I know not what the matter is; but, to my
    judgment, your highness is not entertained with that
    ceremonious affection as you were wont; there's a
    great abatement of kindness appears as well in the
    general dependants as in the duke himself also and
    your daughter.

KING LEAR

    Ha! sayest thou so?

Knight

    I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken;
    for my duty cannot be silent when I think your
    highness wronged.

KING LEAR

    Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception: I
    have perceived a most faint neglect of late; which I
    have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity
    than as a very pretence and purpose of unkindness:
    I will look further into't. But where's my fool? I
    have not seen him this two days.

Knight

    Since my young lady's going into France, sir, the
    fool hath much pined away.

KING LEAR

    No more of that; I have noted it well. Go you, and
    tell my daughter I would speak with her.

    Exit an Attendant
    Go you, call hither my fool.

    Exit an Attendant

    Re-enter OSWALD
    O, you sir, you, come you hither, sir: who am I,
    sir?

OSWALD

    My lady's father.

KING LEAR

    'My lady's father'! my lord's knave: your
    whoreson dog! you slave! you cur!

OSWALD

    I am none of these, my lord; I beseech your pardon.

KING LEAR

    Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?

    Striking him

OSWALD

    I'll not be struck, my lord.

KENT

    Nor tripped neither, you base football player.

    Tripping up his heels

KING LEAR

    I thank thee, fellow; thou servest me, and I'll
    love thee.

KENT

    Come, sir, arise, away! I'll teach you differences:
    away, away! if you will measure your lubber's
    length again, tarry: but away! go to; have you
    wisdom? so.

    Pushes OSWALD out

KING LEAR

    Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee: there's
    earnest of thy service.

    Giving KENT money

    Enter Fool

Fool

    Let me hire him too: here's my coxcomb.

    Offering KENT his cap

KING LEAR

    How now, my pretty knave! how dost thou?

Fool

    Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.

KENT

    Why, fool?

Fool

    Why, for taking one's part that's out of favour:
    nay, an thou canst not smile as the wind sits,
    thou'lt catch cold shortly: there, take my coxcomb:
    why, this fellow has banished two on's daughters,
    and did the third a blessing against his will; if
    thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.
    How now, nuncle! Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters!

KING LEAR

    Why, my boy?

Fool

    If I gave them all my living, I'ld keep my coxcombs
    myself. There's mine; beg another of thy daughters.

KING LEAR

    Take heed, sirrah; the whip.

Fool

    Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be whipped
    out, when Lady the brach may stand by the fire and stink.

KING LEAR

    A pestilent gall to me!

Fool

    Sirrah, I'll teach thee a speech.

KING LEAR

    Do.

Fool

    Mark it, nuncle:
    Have more than thou showest,
    Speak less than thou knowest,
    Lend less than thou owest,
    Ride more than thou goest,
    Learn more than thou trowest,
    Set less than thou throwest;
    Leave thy drink and thy whore,
    And keep in-a-door,
    And thou shalt have more
    Than two tens to a score.

KENT

    This is nothing, fool.

Fool

    Then 'tis like the breath of an unfee'd lawyer; you
    gave me nothing for't. Can you make no use of
    nothing, nuncle?

KING LEAR

    Why, no, boy; nothing can be made out of nothing.

Fool

    [To KENT] Prithee, tell him, so much the rent of
    his land comes to: he will not believe a fool.

KING LEAR

    A bitter fool!

Fool

    Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a
    bitter fool and a sweet fool?

KING LEAR

    No, lad; teach me.

Fool

    That lord that counsell'd thee
    To give away thy land,
    Come place him here by me,
    Do thou for him stand:
    The sweet and bitter fool
    Will presently appear;
    The one in motley here,
    The other found out there.

KING LEAR

    Dost thou call me fool, boy?

Fool

    All thy other titles thou hast given away; that
    thou wast born with.

KENT

    This is not altogether fool, my lord.

Fool

    No, faith, lords and great men will not let me; if
    I had a monopoly out, they would have part on't:
    and ladies too, they will not let me have all fool
    to myself; they'll be snatching. Give me an egg,
    nuncle, and I'll give thee two crowns.

KING LEAR

    What two crowns shall they be?

Fool

    Why, after I have cut the egg i' the middle, and eat
    up the meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou
    clovest thy crown i' the middle, and gavest away
    both parts, thou borest thy ass on thy back o'er
    the dirt: thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown,
    when thou gavest thy golden one away. If I speak
    like myself in this, let him be whipped that first
    finds it so.

    Singing
    Fools had ne'er less wit in a year;
    For wise men are grown foppish,
    They know not how their wits to wear,
    Their manners are so apish.

KING LEAR

    When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?

Fool

    I have used it, nuncle, ever since thou madest thy
    daughters thy mothers: for when thou gavest them
    the rod, and put'st down thine own breeches,

    Singing
    Then they for sudden joy did weep,
    And I for sorrow sung,
    That such a king should play bo-peep,
    And go the fools among.
    Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach
    thy fool to lie: I would fain learn to lie.

KING LEAR

    An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipped.

Fool

    I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are:
    they'll have me whipped for speaking true, thou'lt
    have me whipped for lying; and sometimes I am
    whipped for holding my peace. I had rather be any
    kind o' thing than a fool: and yet I would not be
    thee, nuncle; thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides,
    and left nothing i' the middle: here comes one o'
    the parings.

    Enter GONERIL

KING LEAR

    How now, daughter! what makes that frontlet on?
    Methinks you are too much of late i' the frown.

Fool

    Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to
    care for her frowning; now thou art an O without a
    figure: I am better than thou art now; I am a fool,
    thou art nothing.

    To GONERIL
    Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue; so your face
    bids me, though you say nothing. Mum, mum,
    He that keeps nor crust nor crum,
    Weary of all, shall want some.

    Pointing to KING LEAR
    That's a shealed peascod.

GONERIL

    Not only, sir, this your all-licensed fool,
    But other of your insolent retinue
    Do hourly carp and quarrel; breaking forth
    In rank and not-to-be endured riots. Sir,
    I had thought, by making this well known unto you,
    To have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful,
    By what yourself too late have spoke and done.
    That you protect this course, and put it on
    By your allowance; which if you should, the fault
    Would not 'scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,
    Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,
    Might in their working do you that offence,
    Which else were shame, that then necessity
    Will call discreet proceeding.

Fool

    For, you trow, nuncle,
    The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long,
    That it's had it head bit off by it young.
    So, out went the candle, and we were left darkling.

KING LEAR

    Are you our daughter?

GONERIL

    Come, sir,
    I would you would make use of that good wisdom,
    Whereof I know you are fraught; and put away
    These dispositions, that of late transform you
    From what you rightly are.

Fool

    May not an ass know when the cart
    draws the horse? Whoop, Jug! I love thee.

KING LEAR

    Doth any here know me? This is not Lear:
    Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?
    Either his notion weakens, his discernings
    Are lethargied--Ha! waking? 'tis not so.
    Who is it that can tell me who I am?

Fool

    Lear's shadow.

KING LEAR

    I would learn that; for, by the
    marks of sovereignty, knowledge, and reason,
    I should be false persuaded I had daughters.

Fool

    Which they will make an obedient father.

KING LEAR

    Your name, fair gentlewoman?

GONERIL

    This admiration, sir, is much o' the savour
    Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you
    To understand my purposes aright:
    As you are old and reverend, you should be wise.
    Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;
    Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd and bold,
    That this our court, infected with their manners,
    Shows like a riotous inn: epicurism and lust
    Make it more like a tavern or a brothel
    Than a graced palace. The shame itself doth speak
    For instant remedy: be then desired
    By her, that else will take the thing she begs,
    A little to disquantity your train;
    And the remainder, that shall still depend,
    To be such men as may besort your age,
    And know themselves and you.

KING LEAR

    Darkness and devils!
    Saddle my horses; call my train together:
    Degenerate bastard! I'll not trouble thee.
    Yet have I left a daughter.

GONERIL

    You strike my people; and your disorder'd rabble
    Make servants of their betters.

    Enter ALBANY

KING LEAR

    Woe, that too late repents,--

    To ALBANY
    O, sir, are you come?
    Is it your will? Speak, sir. Prepare my horses.
    Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,
    More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child
    Than the sea-monster!

ALBANY

    Pray, sir, be patient.

KING LEAR

    [To GONERIL] Detested kite! thou liest.
    My train are men of choice and rarest parts,
    That all particulars of duty know,
    And in the most exact regard support
    The worships of their name. O most small fault,
    How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!
    That, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of nature
    From the fix'd place; drew from heart all love,
    And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!
    Beat at this gate, that let thy folly in,

    Striking his head
    And thy dear judgment out! Go, go, my people.

ALBANY

    My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant
    Of what hath moved you.

KING LEAR

    It may be so, my lord.
    Hear, nature, hear; dear goddess, hear!
    Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend
    To make this creature fruitful!
    Into her womb convey sterility!
    Dry up in her the organs of increase;
    And from her derogate body never spring
    A babe to honour her! If she must teem,
    Create her child of spleen; that it may live,
    And be a thwart disnatured torment to her!
    Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth;
    With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks;
    Turn all her mother's pains and benefits
    To laughter and contempt; that she may feel
    How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is
    To have a thankless child! Away, away!

    Exit

ALBANY

    Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?

GONERIL

    Never afflict yourself to know the cause;
    But let his disposition have that scope
    That dotage gives it.

    Re-enter KING LEAR

KING LEAR

    What, fifty of my followers at a clap!
    Within a fortnight!

ALBANY

    What's the matter, sir?

KING LEAR

    I'll tell thee:

    To GONERIL
    Life and death! I am ashamed
    That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;
    That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,
    Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!
    The untented woundings of a father's curse
    Pierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes,
    Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out,
    And cast you, with the waters that you lose,
    To temper clay. Yea, it is come to this?
    Let is be so: yet have I left a daughter,
    Who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable:
    When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails
    She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find
    That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think
    I have cast off for ever: thou shalt,
    I warrant thee.

    Exeunt KING LEAR, KENT, and Attendants

GONERIL

    Do you mark that, my lord?

ALBANY

    I cannot be so partial, Goneril,
    To the great love I bear you,--

GONERIL

    Pray you, content. What, Oswald, ho!

    To the Fool
    You, sir, more knave than fool, after your master.

Fool

    Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry and take the fool
    with thee.
    A fox, when one has caught her,
    And such a daughter,
    Should sure to the slaughter,
    If my cap would buy a halter:
    So the fool follows after.

    Exit

GONERIL

    This man hath had good counsel:--a hundred knights!
    'Tis politic and safe to let him keep
    At point a hundred knights: yes, that, on every dream,
    Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
    He may enguard his dotage with their powers,
    And hold our lives in mercy. Oswald, I say!

ALBANY

    Well, you may fear too far.

GONERIL

    Safer than trust too far:
    Let me still take away the harms I fear,
    Not fear still to be taken: I know his heart.
    What he hath utter'd I have writ my sister
    If she sustain him and his hundred knights
    When I have show'd the unfitness,--

    Re-enter OSWALD
    How now, Oswald!
    What, have you writ that letter to my sister?

OSWALD

    Yes, madam.

GONERIL

    Take you some company, and away to horse:
    Inform her full of my particular fear;
    And thereto add such reasons of your own
    As may compact it more. Get you gone;
    And hasten your return.

    Exit OSWALD
    No, no, my lord,
    This milky gentleness and course of yours
    Though I condemn not, yet, under pardon,
    You are much more attask'd for want of wisdom
    Than praised for harmful mildness.

ALBANY

    How far your eyes may pierce I can not tell:
    Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.

GONERIL

    Nay, then--

ALBANY

    Well, well; the event.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Court before the same.

    Enter KING LEAR, KENT, and Fool 

KING LEAR

    Go you before to Gloucester with these letters.
    Acquaint my daughter no further with any thing you
    know than comes from her demand out of the letter.
    If your diligence be not speedy, I shall be there afore you.

KENT

    I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered
    your letter.

    Exit

Fool

    If a man's brains were in's heels, were't not in
    danger of kibes?

KING LEAR

    Ay, boy.

Fool

    Then, I prithee, be merry; thy wit shall ne'er go
    slip-shod.

KING LEAR

    Ha, ha, ha!

Fool

    Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly;
    for though she's as like this as a crab's like an
    apple, yet I can tell what I can tell.

KING LEAR

    Why, what canst thou tell, my boy?

Fool

    She will taste as like this as a crab does to a
    crab. Thou canst tell why one's nose stands i'
    the middle on's face?

KING LEAR

    No.

Fool

    Why, to keep one's eyes of either side's nose; that
    what a man cannot smell out, he may spy into.

KING LEAR

    I did her wrong--

Fool

    Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?

KING LEAR

    No.

Fool

    Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house.

KING LEAR

    Why?

Fool

    Why, to put his head in; not to give it away to his
    daughters, and leave his horns without a case.

KING LEAR

    I will forget my nature. So kind a father! Be my
    horses ready?

Fool

    Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why the
    seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason.

KING LEAR

    Because they are not eight?

Fool

    Yes, indeed: thou wouldst make a good fool.

KING LEAR

    To take 't again perforce! Monster ingratitude!

Fool

    If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I'ld have thee beaten
    for being old before thy time.

KING LEAR

    How's that?

Fool

    Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst
    been wise.

KING LEAR

    O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven
    Keep me in temper: I would not be mad!

    Enter Gentleman
    How now! are the horses ready?

Gentleman

    Ready, my lord.

KING LEAR

    Come, boy.

Fool

    She that's a maid now, and laughs at my departure,
    Shall not be a maid long, unless things be cut shorter.

    Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. GLOUCESTER's castle.

    Enter EDMUND, and CURAN meets him 

EDMUND

    Save thee, Curan.

CURAN

    And you, sir. I have been with your father, and
    given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan
    his duchess will be here with him this night.

EDMUND

    How comes that?

CURAN

    Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad;
    I mean the whispered ones, for they are yet but
    ear-kissing arguments?

EDMUND

    Not I pray you, what are they?

CURAN

    Have you heard of no likely wars toward, 'twixt the
    Dukes of Cornwall and Albany?

EDMUND

    Not a word.

CURAN

    You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.

    Exit

EDMUND

    The duke be here to-night? The better! best!
    This weaves itself perforce into my business.
    My father hath set guard to take my brother;
    And I have one thing, of a queasy question,
    Which I must act: briefness and fortune, work!
    Brother, a word; descend: brother, I say!

    Enter EDGAR
    My father watches: O sir, fly this place;
    Intelligence is given where you are hid;
    You have now the good advantage of the night:
    Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?
    He's coming hither: now, i' the night, i' the haste,
    And Regan with him: have you nothing said
    Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?
    Advise yourself.

EDGAR

    I am sure on't, not a word.

EDMUND

    I hear my father coming: pardon me:
    In cunning I must draw my sword upon you
    Draw; seem to defend yourself; now quit you well.
    Yield: come before my father. Light, ho, here!
    Fly, brother. Torches, torches! So, farewell.

    Exit EDGAR
    Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion.

    Wounds his arm
    Of my more fierce endeavour: I have seen drunkards
    Do more than this in sport. Father, father!
    Stop, stop! No help?

    Enter GLOUCESTER, and Servants with torches

GLOUCESTER

    Now, Edmund, where's the villain?

EDMUND

    Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,
    Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon
    To stand auspicious mistress,--

GLOUCESTER

    But where is he?

EDMUND

    Look, sir, I bleed.

GLOUCESTER

    Where is the villain, Edmund?

EDMUND

    Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could--

GLOUCESTER

    Pursue him, ho! Go after.

    Exeunt some Servants
    By no means what?

EDMUND

    Persuade me to the murder of your lordship;
    But that I told him, the revenging gods
    'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;
    Spoke, with how manifold and strong a bond
    The child was bound to the father; sir, in fine,
    Seeing how loathly opposite I stood
    To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion,
    With his prepared sword, he charges home
    My unprovided body, lanced mine arm:
    But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits,
    Bold in the quarrel's right, roused to the encounter,
    Or whether gasted by the noise I made,
    Full suddenly he fled.

GLOUCESTER

    Let him fly far:
    Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;
    And found--dispatch. The noble duke my master,
    My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night:
    By his authority I will proclaim it,
    That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,
    Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;
    He that conceals him, death.

EDMUND

    When I dissuaded him from his intent,
    And found him pight to do it, with curst speech
    I threaten'd to discover him: he replied,
    'Thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou think,
    If I would stand against thee, would the reposal
    Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee
    Make thy words faith'd? No: what I should deny,--
    As this I would: ay, though thou didst produce
    My very character,--I'ld turn it all
    To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practise:
    And thou must make a dullard of the world,
    If they not thought the profits of my death
    Were very pregnant and potential spurs
    To make thee seek it.'

GLOUCESTER

    Strong and fasten'd villain
    Would he deny his letter? I never got him.

    Tucket within
    Hark, the duke's trumpets! I know not why he comes.
    All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not 'scape;
    The duke must grant me that: besides, his picture
    I will send far and near, that all the kingdom
    May have the due note of him; and of my land,
    Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means
    To make thee capable.

    Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, and Attendants

CORNWALL

    How now, my noble friend! since I came hither,
    Which I can call but now, I have heard strange news.

REGAN

    If it be true, all vengeance comes too short
    Which can pursue the offender. How dost, my lord?

GLOUCESTER

    O, madam, my old heart is crack'd, it's crack'd!

REGAN

    What, did my father's godson seek your life?
    He whom my father named? your Edgar?

GLOUCESTER

    O, lady, lady, shame would have it hid!

REGAN

    Was he not companion with the riotous knights
    That tend upon my father?

GLOUCESTER

    I know not, madam: 'tis too bad, too bad.

EDMUND

    Yes, madam, he was of that consort.

REGAN

    No marvel, then, though he were ill affected:
    'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,
    To have the expense and waste of his revenues.
    I have this present evening from my sister
    Been well inform'd of them; and with such cautions,
    That if they come to sojourn at my house,
    I'll not be there.

CORNWALL

    Nor I, assure thee, Regan.
    Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father
    A child-like office.

EDMUND

    'Twas my duty, sir.

GLOUCESTER

    He did bewray his practise; and received
    This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.

CORNWALL

    Is he pursued?

GLOUCESTER

    Ay, my good lord.

CORNWALL

    If he be taken, he shall never more
    Be fear'd of doing harm: make your own purpose,
    How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,
    Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant
    So much commend itself, you shall be ours:
    Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;
    You we first seize on.

EDMUND

    I shall serve you, sir,
    Truly, however else.

GLOUCESTER

    For him I thank your grace.

CORNWALL

    You know not why we came to visit you,--

REGAN

    Thus out of season, threading dark-eyed night:
    Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,
    Wherein we must have use of your advice:
    Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,
    Of differences, which I least thought it fit
    To answer from our home; the several messengers
    From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,
    Lay comforts to your bosom; and bestow
    Your needful counsel to our business,
    Which craves the instant use.

GLOUCESTER

    I serve you, madam:
    Your graces are right welcome.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Before Gloucester's castle.

    Enter KENT and OSWALD, severally 

OSWALD

    Good dawning to thee, friend: art of this house?

KENT

    Ay.

OSWALD

    Where may we set our horses?

KENT

    I' the mire.

OSWALD

    Prithee, if thou lovest me, tell me.

KENT

    I love thee not.

OSWALD

    Why, then, I care not for thee.

KENT

    If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make thee
    care for me.

OSWALD

    Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.

KENT

    Fellow, I know thee.

OSWALD

    What dost thou know me for?

KENT

    A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a
    base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited,
    hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave; a
    lily-livered, action-taking knave, a whoreson,
    glass-gazing, super-serviceable finical rogue;
    one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a
    bawd, in way of good service, and art nothing but
    the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pandar,
    and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch: one whom I
    will beat into clamorous whining, if thou deniest
    the least syllable of thy addition.

OSWALD

    Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail
    on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee!

KENT

    What a brazen-faced varlet art thou, to deny thou
    knowest me! Is it two days ago since I tripped up
    thy heels, and beat thee before the king? Draw, you
    rogue: for, though it be night, yet the moon
    shines; I'll make a sop o' the moonshine of you:
    draw, you whoreson cullionly barber-monger, draw.

    Drawing his sword

OSWALD

    Away! I have nothing to do with thee.

KENT

    Draw, you rascal: you come with letters against the
    king; and take vanity the puppet's part against the
    royalty of her father: draw, you rogue, or I'll so
    carbonado your shanks: draw, you rascal; come your ways.

OSWALD

    Help, ho! murder! help!

KENT

    Strike, you slave; stand, rogue, stand; you neat
    slave, strike.

    Beating him

OSWALD

    Help, ho! murder! murder!

    Enter EDMUND, with his rapier drawn, CORNWALL, REGAN, GLOUCESTER, and Servants

EDMUND

    How now! What's the matter?

KENT

    With you, goodman boy, an you please: come, I'll
    flesh ye; come on, young master.

GLOUCESTER

    Weapons! arms! What 's the matter here?

CORNWALL

    Keep peace, upon your lives:
    He dies that strikes again. What is the matter?

REGAN

    The messengers from our sister and the king.

CORNWALL

    What is your difference? speak.

OSWALD

    I am scarce in breath, my lord.

KENT

    No marvel, you have so bestirred your valour. You
    cowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee: a
    tailor made thee.

CORNWALL

    Thou art a strange fellow: a tailor make a man?

KENT

    Ay, a tailor, sir: a stone-cutter or painter could
    not have made him so ill, though he had been but two
    hours at the trade.

CORNWALL

    Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?

OSWALD

    This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spared
    at suit of his gray beard,--

KENT

    Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My
    lord, if you will give me leave, I will tread this
    unbolted villain into mortar, and daub the wall of
    a jakes with him. Spare my gray beard, you wagtail?

CORNWALL

    Peace, sirrah!
    You beastly knave, know you no reverence?

KENT

    Yes, sir; but anger hath a privilege.

CORNWALL

    Why art thou angry?

KENT

    That such a slave as this should wear a sword,
    Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,
    Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain
    Which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion
    That in the natures of their lords rebel;
    Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;
    Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks
    With every gale and vary of their masters,
    Knowing nought, like dogs, but following.
    A plague upon your epileptic visage!
    Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?
    Goose, if I had you upon Sarum plain,
    I'ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot.

CORNWALL

    Why, art thou mad, old fellow?

GLOUCESTER

    How fell you out? say that.

KENT

    No contraries hold more antipathy
    Than I and such a knave.

CORNWALL

    Why dost thou call him a knave? What's his offence?

KENT

    His countenance likes me not.

CORNWALL

    No more, perchance, does mine, nor his, nor hers.

KENT

    Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain:
    I have seen better faces in my time
    Than stands on any shoulder that I see
    Before me at this instant.

CORNWALL

    This is some fellow,
    Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect
    A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb
    Quite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he,
    An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth!
    An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain.
    These kind of knaves I know, which in this plainness
    Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
    Than twenty silly ducking observants
    That stretch their duties nicely.

KENT

    Sir, in good sooth, in sincere verity,
    Under the allowance of your great aspect,
    Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire
    On flickering Phoebus' front,--

CORNWALL

    What mean'st by this?

KENT

    To go out of my dialect, which you
    discommend so much. I know, sir, I am no
    flatterer: he that beguiled you in a plain
    accent was a plain knave; which for my part
    I will not be, though I should win your displeasure
    to entreat me to 't.

CORNWALL

    What was the offence you gave him?

OSWALD

    I never gave him any:
    It pleased the king his master very late
    To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;
    When he, conjunct and flattering his displeasure,
    Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd,
    And put upon him such a deal of man,
    That worthied him, got praises of the king
    For him attempting who was self-subdued;
    And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,
    Drew on me here again.

KENT

    None of these rogues and cowards
    But Ajax is their fool.

CORNWALL

    Fetch forth the stocks!
    You stubborn ancient knave, you reverend braggart,
    We'll teach you--

KENT

    Sir, I am too old to learn:
    Call not your stocks for me: I serve the king;
    On whose employment I was sent to you:
    You shall do small respect, show too bold malice
    Against the grace and person of my master,
    Stocking his messenger.

CORNWALL

    Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,
    There shall he sit till noon.

REGAN

    Till noon! till night, my lord; and all night too.

KENT

    Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,
    You should not use me so.

REGAN

    Sir, being his knave, I will.

CORNWALL

    This is a fellow of the self-same colour
    Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks!

    Stocks brought out

GLOUCESTER

    Let me beseech your grace not to do so:
    His fault is much, and the good king his master
    Will cheque him for 't: your purposed low correction
    Is such as basest and contemned'st wretches
    For pilferings and most common trespasses
    Are punish'd with: the king must take it ill,
    That he's so slightly valued in his messenger,
    Should have him thus restrain'd.

CORNWALL

    I'll answer that.

REGAN

    My sister may receive it much more worse,
    To have her gentleman abused, assaulted,
    For following her affairs. Put in his legs.

    KENT is put in the stocks
    Come, my good lord, away.

    Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER and KENT

GLOUCESTER

    I am sorry for thee, friend; 'tis the duke's pleasure,
    Whose disposition, all the world well knows,
    Will not be rubb'd nor stopp'd: I'll entreat for thee.

KENT

    Pray, do not, sir: I have watched and travell'd hard;
    Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.
    A good man's fortune may grow out at heels:
    Give you good morrow!

GLOUCESTER

    The duke's to blame in this; 'twill be ill taken.

    Exit

KENT

    Good king, that must approve the common saw,
    Thou out of heaven's benediction comest
    To the warm sun!
    Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,
    That by thy comfortable beams I may
    Peruse this letter! Nothing almost sees miracles
    But misery: I know 'tis from Cordelia,
    Who hath most fortunately been inform'd
    Of my obscured course; and shall find time
    From this enormous state, seeking to give
    Losses their remedies. All weary and o'erwatch'd,
    Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold
    This shameful lodging.
    Fortune, good night: smile once more: turn thy wheel!

    Sleeps

SCENE III. A wood.

    Enter EDGAR 

EDGAR

    I heard myself proclaim'd;
    And by the happy hollow of a tree
    Escaped the hunt. No port is free; no place,
    That guard, and most unusual vigilance,
    Does not attend my taking. Whiles I may 'scape,
    I will preserve myself: and am bethought
    To take the basest and most poorest shape
    That ever penury, in contempt of man,
    Brought near to beast: my face I'll grime with filth;
    Blanket my loins: elf all my hair in knots;
    And with presented nakedness out-face
    The winds and persecutions of the sky.
    The country gives me proof and precedent
    Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,
    Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms
    Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;
    And with this horrible object, from low farms,
    Poor pelting villages, sheep-cotes, and mills,
    Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,
    Enforce their charity. Poor Turlygod! poor Tom!
    That's something yet: Edgar I nothing am.

    Exit

SCENE IV. Before GLOUCESTER's castle. KENT in the stocks.

    Enter KING LEAR, Fool, and Gentleman 

KING LEAR

    'Tis strange that they should so depart from home,
    And not send back my messenger.

Gentleman

    As I learn'd,
    The night before there was no purpose in them
    Of this remove.

KENT

    Hail to thee, noble master!

KING LEAR

    Ha!
    Makest thou this shame thy pastime?

KENT

    No, my lord.

Fool

    Ha, ha! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied
    by the heads, dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by
    the loins, and men by the legs: when a man's
    over-lusty at legs, then he wears wooden
    nether-stocks.

KING LEAR

    What's he that hath so much thy place mistook
    To set thee here?

KENT

    It is both he and she;
    Your son and daughter.

KING LEAR

    No.

KENT

    Yes.

KING LEAR

    No, I say.

KENT

    I say, yea.

KING LEAR

    No, no, they would not.

KENT

    Yes, they have.

KING LEAR

    By Jupiter, I swear, no.

KENT

    By Juno, I swear, ay.

KING LEAR

    They durst not do 't;
    They could not, would not do 't; 'tis worse than murder,
    To do upon respect such violent outrage:
    Resolve me, with all modest haste, which way
    Thou mightst deserve, or they impose, this usage,
    Coming from us.

KENT

    My lord, when at their home
    I did commend your highness' letters to them,
    Ere I was risen from the place that show'd
    My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,
    Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth
    From Goneril his mistress salutations;
    Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,
    Which presently they read: on whose contents,
    They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse;
    Commanded me to follow, and attend
    The leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks:
    And meeting here the other messenger,
    Whose welcome, I perceived, had poison'd mine,--
    Being the very fellow that of late
    Display'd so saucily against your highness,--
    Having more man than wit about me, drew:
    He raised the house with loud and coward cries.
    Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
    The shame which here it suffers.

Fool

    Winter's not gone yet, if the wild-geese fly that way.
    Fathers that wear rags
    Do make their children blind;
    But fathers that bear bags
    Shall see their children kind.
    Fortune, that arrant whore,
    Ne'er turns the key to the poor.
    But, for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours
    for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year.

KING LEAR

    O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!
    Hysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow,
    Thy element's below! Where is this daughter?

KENT

    With the earl, sir, here within.

KING LEAR

    Follow me not;
    Stay here.

    Exit

Gentleman

    Made you no more offence but what you speak of?

KENT

    None.
    How chance the king comes with so small a train?

Fool

    And thou hadst been set i' the stocks for that
    question, thou hadst well deserved it.

KENT

    Why, fool?

Fool

    We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee
    there's no labouring i' the winter. All that follow
    their noses are led by their eyes but blind men; and
    there's not a nose among twenty but can smell him
    that's stinking. Let go thy hold when a great wheel
    runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with
    following it: but the great one that goes up the
    hill, let him draw thee after. When a wise man
    gives thee better counsel, give me mine again: I
    would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.
    That sir which serves and seeks for gain,
    And follows but for form,
    Will pack when it begins to rain,
    And leave thee in the storm,
    But I will tarry; the fool will stay,
    And let the wise man fly:
    The knave turns fool that runs away;
    The fool no knave, perdy.

KENT

    Where learned you this, fool?

Fool

    Not i' the stocks, fool.

    Re-enter KING LEAR with GLOUCESTER

KING LEAR

    Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary?
    They have travell'd all the night? Mere fetches;
    The images of revolt and flying off.
    Fetch me a better answer.

GLOUCESTER

    My dear lord,
    You know the fiery quality of the duke;
    How unremoveable and fix'd he is
    In his own course.

KING LEAR

    Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!
    Fiery? what quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,
    I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.

GLOUCESTER

    Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so.

KING LEAR

    Inform'd them! Dost thou understand me, man?

GLOUCESTER

    Ay, my good lord.

KING LEAR

    The king would speak with Cornwall; the dear father
    Would with his daughter speak, commands her service:
    Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood!
    Fiery? the fiery duke? Tell the hot duke that--
    No, but not yet: may be he is not well:
    Infirmity doth still neglect all office
    Whereto our health is bound; we are not ourselves
    When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind
    To suffer with the body: I'll forbear;
    And am fall'n out with my more headier will,
    To take the indisposed and sickly fit
    For the sound man. Death on my state! wherefore

    Looking on KENT
    Should he sit here? This act persuades me
    That this remotion of the duke and her
    Is practise only. Give me my servant forth.
    Go tell the duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them,
    Now, presently: bid them come forth and hear me,
    Or at their chamber-door I'll beat the drum
    Till it cry sleep to death.

GLOUCESTER

    I would have all well betwixt you.

    Exit

KING LEAR

    O me, my heart, my rising heart! but, down!

Fool

    Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels
    when she put 'em i' the paste alive; she knapped 'em
    o' the coxcombs with a stick, and cried 'Down,
    wantons, down!' 'Twas her brother that, in pure
    kindness to his horse, buttered his hay.

    Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, GLOUCESTER, and Servants

KING LEAR

    Good morrow to you both.

CORNWALL

    Hail to your grace!

    KENT is set at liberty

REGAN

    I am glad to see your highness.

KING LEAR

    Regan, I think you are; I know what reason
    I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,
    I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,
    Sepulchring an adultress.

    To KENT
    O, are you free?
    Some other time for that. Beloved Regan,
    Thy sister's naught: O Regan, she hath tied
    Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here:

    Points to his heart
    I can scarce speak to thee; thou'lt not believe
    With how depraved a quality--O Regan!

REGAN

    I pray you, sir, take patience: I have hope.
    You less know how to value her desert
    Than she to scant her duty.

KING LEAR

    Say, how is that?

REGAN

    I cannot think my sister in the least
    Would fail her obligation: if, sir, perchance
    She have restrain'd the riots of your followers,
    'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,
    As clears her from all blame.

KING LEAR

    My curses on her!

REGAN

    O, sir, you are old.
    Nature in you stands on the very verge
    Of her confine: you should be ruled and led
    By some discretion, that discerns your state
    Better than you yourself. Therefore, I pray you,
    That to our sister you do make return;
    Say you have wrong'd her, sir.

KING LEAR

    Ask her forgiveness?
    Do you but mark how this becomes the house:
    'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old;

    Kneeling
    Age is unnecessary: on my knees I beg
    That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.'

REGAN

    Good sir, no more; these are unsightly tricks:
    Return you to my sister.

KING LEAR

    [Rising] Never, Regan:
    She hath abated me of half my train;
    Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,
    Most serpent-like, upon the very heart:
    All the stored vengeances of heaven fall
    On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,
    You taking airs, with lameness!

CORNWALL

    Fie, sir, fie!

KING LEAR

    You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames
    Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,
    You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the powerful sun,
    To fall and blast her pride!

REGAN

    O the blest gods! so will you wish on me,
    When the rash mood is on.

KING LEAR

    No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse:
    Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give
    Thee o'er to harshness: her eyes are fierce; but thine
    Do comfort and not burn. 'Tis not in thee
    To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,
    To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,
    And in conclusion to oppose the bolt
    Against my coming in: thou better know'st
    The offices of nature, bond of childhood,
    Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude;
    Thy half o' the kingdom hast thou not forgot,
    Wherein I thee endow'd.

REGAN

    Good sir, to the purpose.

KING LEAR

    Who put my man i' the stocks?

    Tucket within

CORNWALL

    What trumpet's that?

REGAN

    I know't, my sister's: this approves her letter,
    That she would soon be here.

    Enter OSWALD
    Is your lady come?

KING LEAR

    This is a slave, whose easy-borrow'd pride
    Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.
    Out, varlet, from my sight!

CORNWALL

    What means your grace?

KING LEAR

    Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hope
    Thou didst not know on't. Who comes here? O heavens,

    Enter GONERIL
    If you do love old men, if your sweet sway
    Allow obedience, if yourselves are old,
    Make it your cause; send down, and take my part!

    To GONERIL
    Art not ashamed to look upon this beard?
    O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?

GONERIL

    Why not by the hand, sir? How have I offended?
    All's not offence that indiscretion finds
    And dotage terms so.

KING LEAR

    O sides, you are too tough;
    Will you yet hold? How came my man i' the stocks?

CORNWALL

    I set him there, sir: but his own disorders
    Deserved much less advancement.

KING LEAR

    You! did you?

REGAN

    I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.
    If, till the expiration of your month,
    You will return and sojourn with my sister,
    Dismissing half your train, come then to me:
    I am now from home, and out of that provision
    Which shall be needful for your entertainment.

KING LEAR

    Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?
    No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose
    To wage against the enmity o' the air;
    To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,--
    Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?
    Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took
    Our youngest born, I could as well be brought
    To knee his throne, and, squire-like; pension beg
    To keep base life afoot. Return with her?
    Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
    To this detested groom.

    Pointing at OSWALD

GONERIL

    At your choice, sir.

KING LEAR

    I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad:
    I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell:
    We'll no more meet, no more see one another:
    But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;
    Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,
    Which I must needs call mine: thou art a boil,
    A plague-sore, an embossed carbuncle,
    In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee;
    Let shame come when it will, I do not call it:
    I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,
    Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove:
    Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure:
    I can be patient; I can stay with Regan,
    I and my hundred knights.

REGAN

    Not altogether so:
    I look'd not for you yet, nor am provided
    For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;
    For those that mingle reason with your passion
    Must be content to think you old, and so--
    But she knows what she does.

KING LEAR

    Is this well spoken?

REGAN

    I dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers?
    Is it not well? What should you need of more?
    Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger
    Speak 'gainst so great a number? How, in one house,
    Should many people, under two commands,
    Hold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impossible.

GONERIL

    Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance
    From those that she calls servants or from mine?

REGAN

    Why not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack you,
    We could control them. If you will come to me,--
    For now I spy a danger,--I entreat you
    To bring but five and twenty: to no more
    Will I give place or notice.

KING LEAR

    I gave you all--

REGAN

    And in good time you gave it.

KING LEAR

    Made you my guardians, my depositaries;
    But kept a reservation to be follow'd
    With such a number. What, must I come to you
    With five and twenty, Regan? said you so?

REGAN

    And speak't again, my lord; no more with me.

KING LEAR

    Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd,
    When others are more wicked: not being the worst
    Stands in some rank of praise.

    To GONERIL
    I'll go with thee:
    Thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty,
    And thou art twice her love.

GONERIL

    Hear me, my lord;
    What need you five and twenty, ten, or five,
    To follow in a house where twice so many
    Have a command to tend you?

REGAN

    What need one?

KING LEAR

    O, reason not the need: our basest beggars
    Are in the poorest thing superfluous:
    Allow not nature more than nature needs,
    Man's life's as cheap as beast's: thou art a lady;
    If only to go warm were gorgeous,
    Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,
    Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,--
    You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!
    You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,
    As full of grief as age; wretched in both!
    If it be you that stir these daughters' hearts
    Against their father, fool me not so much
    To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,
    And let not women's weapons, water-drops,
    Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,
    I will have such revenges on you both,
    That all the world shall--I will do such things,--
    What they are, yet I know not: but they shall be
    The terrors of the earth. You think I'll weep
    No, I'll not weep:
    I have full cause of weeping; but this heart
    Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws,
    Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!

    Exeunt KING LEAR, GLOUCESTER, KENT, and Fool

    Storm and tempest

CORNWALL

    Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm.

REGAN

    This house is little: the old man and his people
    Cannot be well bestow'd.

GONERIL

    'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest,
    And must needs taste his folly.

REGAN

    For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,
    But not one follower.

GONERIL

    So am I purposed.
    Where is my lord of Gloucester?

CORNWALL

    Follow'd the old man forth: he is return'd.

    Re-enter GLOUCESTER

GLOUCESTER

    The king is in high rage.

CORNWALL

    Whither is he going?

GLOUCESTER

    He calls to horse; but will I know not whither.

CORNWALL

    'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.

GONERIL

    My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.

GLOUCESTER

    Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak winds
    Do sorely ruffle; for many miles a bout
    There's scarce a bush.

REGAN

    O, sir, to wilful men,
    The injuries that they themselves procure
    Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors:
    He is attended with a desperate train;
    And what they may incense him to, being apt
    To have his ear abused, wisdom bids fear.

CORNWALL

    Shut up your doors, my lord; 'tis a wild night:
    My Regan counsels well; come out o' the storm.

    Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. A heath.

    Storm still. Enter KENT and a Gentleman, meeting 

KENT

    Who's there, besides foul weather?

Gentleman

    One minded like the weather, most unquietly.

KENT

    I know you. Where's the king?

Gentleman

    Contending with the fretful element:
    Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea,
    Or swell the curled water 'bove the main,
    That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,
    Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,
    Catch in their fury, and make nothing of;
    Strives in his little world of man to out-scorn
    The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.
    This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,
    The lion and the belly-pinched wolf
    Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,
    And bids what will take all.

KENT

    But who is with him?

Gentleman

    None but the fool; who labours to out-jest
    His heart-struck injuries.

KENT

    Sir, I do know you;
    And dare, upon the warrant of my note,
    Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,
    Although as yet the face of it be cover'd
    With mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;
    Who have--as who have not, that their great stars
    Throned and set high?--servants, who seem no less,
    Which are to France the spies and speculations
    Intelligent of our state; what hath been seen,
    Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,
    Or the hard rein which both of them have borne
    Against the old kind king; or something deeper,
    Whereof perchance these are but furnishings;
    But, true it is, from France there comes a power
    Into this scatter'd kingdom; who already,
    Wise in our negligence, have secret feet
    In some of our best ports, and are at point
    To show their open banner. Now to you:
    If on my credit you dare build so far
    To make your speed to Dover, you shall find
    Some that will thank you, making just report
    Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
    The king hath cause to plain.
    I am a gentleman of blood and breeding;
    And, from some knowledge and assurance, offer
    This office to you.

Gentleman

    I will talk further with you.

KENT

    No, do not.
    For confirmation that I am much more
    Than my out-wall, open this purse, and take
    What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia,--
    As fear not but you shall,--show her this ring;
    And she will tell you who your fellow is
    That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!
    I will go seek the king.

Gentleman

    Give me your hand: have you no more to say?

KENT

    Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet;
    That, when we have found the king,--in which your pain
    That way, I'll this,--he that first lights on him
    Holla the other.

    Exeunt severally

SCENE II. Another part of the heath. Storm still.

    Enter KING LEAR and Fool 

KING LEAR

    Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!
    You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout
    Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!
    You sulphurous and thought-executing fires,
    Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,
    Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,
    Smite flat the thick rotundity o' the world!
    Crack nature's moulds, an germens spill at once,
    That make ingrateful man!

Fool

    O nuncle, court holy-water in a dry
    house is better than this rain-water out o' door.
    Good nuncle, in, and ask thy daughters' blessing:
    here's a night pities neither wise man nor fool.

KING LEAR

    Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain!
    Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire, are my daughters:
    I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness;
    I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children,
    You owe me no subscription: then let fall
    Your horrible pleasure: here I stand, your slave,
    A poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man:
    But yet I call you servile ministers,
    That have with two pernicious daughters join'd
    Your high engender'd battles 'gainst a head
    So old and white as this. O! O! 'tis foul!

Fool

    He that has a house to put's head in has a good
    head-piece.
    The cod-piece that will house
    Before the head has any,
    The head and he shall louse;
    So beggars marry many.
    The man that makes his toe
    What he his heart should make
    Shall of a corn cry woe,
    And turn his sleep to wake.
    For there was never yet fair woman but she made
    mouths in a glass.

KING LEAR

    No, I will be the pattern of all patience;
    I will say nothing.

    Enter KENT

KENT

    Who's there?

Fool

    Marry, here's grace and a cod-piece; that's a wise
    man and a fool.

KENT

    Alas, sir, are you here? things that love night
    Love not such nights as these; the wrathful skies
    Gallow the very wanderers of the dark,
    And make them keep their caves: since I was man,
    Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,
    Such groans of roaring wind and rain, I never
    Remember to have heard: man's nature cannot carry
    The affliction nor the fear.

KING LEAR

    Let the great gods,
    That keep this dreadful pother o'er our heads,
    Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,
    That hast within thee undivulged crimes,
    Unwhipp'd of justice: hide thee, thou bloody hand;
    Thou perjured, and thou simular man of virtue
    That art incestuous: caitiff, to pieces shake,
    That under covert and convenient seeming
    Hast practised on man's life: close pent-up guilts,
    Rive your concealing continents, and cry
    These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man
    More sinn'd against than sinning.

KENT

    Alack, bare-headed!
    Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel;
    Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest:
    Repose you there; while I to this hard house--
    More harder than the stones whereof 'tis raised;
    Which even but now, demanding after you,
    Denied me to come in--return, and force
    Their scanted courtesy.

KING LEAR

    My wits begin to turn.
    Come on, my boy: how dost, my boy? art cold?
    I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow?
    The art of our necessities is strange,
    That can make vile things precious. Come,
    your hovel.
    Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart
    That's sorry yet for thee.

Fool

    [Singing]
    He that has and a little tiny wit--
    With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,--
    Must make content with his fortunes fit,
    For the rain it raineth every day.

KING LEAR

    True, my good boy. Come, bring us to this hovel.

    Exeunt KING LEAR and KENT

Fool

    This is a brave night to cool a courtezan.
    I'll speak a prophecy ere I go:
    When priests are more in word than matter;
    When brewers mar their malt with water;
    When nobles are their tailors' tutors;
    No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors;
    When every case in law is right;
    No squire in debt, nor no poor knight;
    When slanders do not live in tongues;
    Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;
    When usurers tell their gold i' the field;
    And bawds and whores do churches build;
    Then shall the realm of Albion
    Come to great confusion:
    Then comes the time, who lives to see't,
    That going shall be used with feet.
    This prophecy Merlin shall make; for I live before his time.

    Exit

SCENE III. Gloucester's castle.

    Enter GLOUCESTER and EDMUND 

GLOUCESTER

    Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural
    dealing. When I desire their leave that I might
    pity him, they took from me the use of mine own
    house; charged me, on pain of their perpetual
    displeasure, neither to speak of him, entreat for
    him, nor any way sustain him.

EDMUND

    Most savage and unnatural!

GLOUCESTER

    Go to; say you nothing. There's a division betwixt
    the dukes; and a worse matter than that: I have
    received a letter this night; 'tis dangerous to be
    spoken; I have locked the letter in my closet:
    these injuries the king now bears will be revenged
    home; there's part of a power already footed: we
    must incline to the king. I will seek him, and
    privily relieve him: go you and maintain talk with
    the duke, that my charity be not of him perceived:
    if he ask for me. I am ill, and gone to bed.
    Though I die for it, as no less is threatened me,
    the king my old master must be relieved. There is
    some strange thing toward, Edmund; pray you, be careful.

    Exit

EDMUND

    This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the duke
    Instantly know; and of that letter too:
    This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me
    That which my father loses; no less than all:
    The younger rises when the old doth fall.

    Exit

SCENE IV. The heath. Before a hovel.

    Enter KING LEAR, KENT, and Fool 

KENT

    Here is the place, my lord; good my lord, enter:
    The tyranny of the open night's too rough
    For nature to endure.

    Storm still

KING LEAR

    Let me alone.

KENT

    Good my lord, enter here.

KING LEAR

    Wilt break my heart?

KENT

    I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter.

KING LEAR

    Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm
    Invades us to the skin: so 'tis to thee;
    But where the greater malady is fix'd,
    The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'ldst shun a bear;
    But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,
    Thou'ldst meet the bear i' the mouth. When the
    mind's free,
    The body's delicate: the tempest in my mind
    Doth from my senses take all feeling else
    Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!
    Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand
    For lifting food to't? But I will punish home:
    No, I will weep no more. In such a night
    To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.
    In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!
    Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all,--
    O, that way madness lies; let me shun that;
    No more of that.

KENT

    Good my lord, enter here.

KING LEAR

    Prithee, go in thyself: seek thine own ease:
    This tempest will not give me leave to ponder
    On things would hurt me more. But I'll go in.

    To the Fool
    In, boy; go first. You houseless poverty,--
    Nay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.

    Fool goes in
    Poor naked wretches, whereso'er you are,
    That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,
    How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,
    Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you
    From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en
    Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp;
    Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
    That thou mayst shake the superflux to them,
    And show the heavens more just.

EDGAR

    [Within] Fathom and half, fathom and half! Poor Tom!

    The Fool runs out from the hovel

Fool

    Come not in here, nuncle, here's a spirit
    Help me, help me!

KENT

    Give me thy hand. Who's there?

Fool

    A spirit, a spirit: he says his name's poor Tom.

KENT

    What art thou that dost grumble there i' the straw?
    Come forth.

    Enter EDGAR disguised as a mad man

EDGAR

    Away! the foul fiend follows me!
    Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind.
    Hum! go to thy cold bed, and warm thee.

KING LEAR

    Hast thou given all to thy two daughters?
    And art thou come to this?

EDGAR

    Who gives any thing to poor Tom? whom the foul
    fiend hath led through fire and through flame, and
    through ford and whirlipool e'er bog and quagmire;
    that hath laid knives under his pillow, and halters
    in his pew; set ratsbane by his porridge; made film
    proud of heart, to ride on a bay trotting-horse over
    four-inched bridges, to course his own shadow for a
    traitor. Bless thy five wits! Tom's a-cold,--O, do
    de, do de, do de. Bless thee from whirlwinds,
    star-blasting, and taking! Do poor Tom some
    charity, whom the foul fiend vexes: there could I
    have him now,--and there,--and there again, and there.

    Storm still

KING LEAR

    What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?
    Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give them all?

Fool

    Nay, he reserved a blanket, else we had been all shamed.

KING LEAR

    Now, all the plagues that in the pendulous air
    Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters!

KENT

    He hath no daughters, sir.

KING LEAR

    Death, traitor! nothing could have subdued nature
    To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.
    Is it the fashion, that discarded fathers
    Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?
    Judicious punishment! 'twas this flesh begot
    Those pelican daughters.

EDGAR

    Pillicock sat on Pillicock-hill:
    Halloo, halloo, loo, loo!

Fool

    This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.

EDGAR

    Take heed o' the foul fiend: obey thy parents;
    keep thy word justly; swear not; commit not with
    man's sworn spouse; set not thy sweet heart on proud
    array. Tom's a-cold.

KING LEAR

    What hast thou been?

EDGAR

    A serving-man, proud in heart and mind; that curled
    my hair; wore gloves in my cap; served the lust of
    my mistress' heart, and did the act of darkness with
    her; swore as many oaths as I spake words, and
    broke them in the sweet face of heaven: one that
    slept in the contriving of lust, and waked to do it:
    wine loved I deeply, dice dearly: and in woman
    out-paramoured the Turk: false of heart, light of
    ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox in stealth,
    wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey.
    Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of
    silks betray thy poor heart to woman: keep thy foot
    out of brothels, thy hand out of plackets, thy pen
    from lenders' books, and defy the foul fiend.
    Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind:
    Says suum, mun, ha, no, nonny.
    Dolphin my boy, my boy, sessa! let him trot by.

    Storm still

KING LEAR

    Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer
    with thy uncovered body this extremity of the skies.
    Is man no more than this? Consider him well. Thou
    owest the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep
    no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha! here's three on
    's are sophisticated! Thou art the thing itself:
    unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor bare,
    forked animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings!
    come unbutton here.

    Tearing off his clothes

Fool

    Prithee, nuncle, be contented; 'tis a naughty night
    to swim in. Now a little fire in a wild field were
    like an old lecher's heart; a small spark, all the
    rest on's body cold. Look, here comes a walking fire.

    Enter GLOUCESTER, with a torch

EDGAR

    This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet: he begins
    at curfew, and walks till the first cock; he gives
    the web and the pin, squints the eye, and makes the
    hare-lip; mildews the white wheat, and hurts the
    poor creature of earth.
    S. Withold footed thrice the old;
    He met the night-mare, and her nine-fold;
    Bid her alight,
    And her troth plight,
    And, aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!

KENT

    How fares your grace?

KING LEAR

    What's he?

KENT

    Who's there? What is't you seek?

GLOUCESTER

    What are you there? Your names?

EDGAR

    Poor Tom; that eats the swimming frog, the toad,
    the tadpole, the wall-newt and the water; that in
    the fury of his heart, when the foul fiend rages,
    eats cow-dung for sallets; swallows the old rat and
    the ditch-dog; drinks the green mantle of the
    standing pool; who is whipped from tithing to
    tithing, and stock- punished, and imprisoned; who
    hath had three suits to his back, six shirts to his
    body, horse to ride, and weapon to wear;
    But mice and rats, and such small deer,
    Have been Tom's food for seven long year.
    Beware my follower. Peace, Smulkin; peace, thou fiend!

GLOUCESTER

    What, hath your grace no better company?

EDGAR

    The prince of darkness is a gentleman:
    Modo he's call'd, and Mahu.

GLOUCESTER

    Our flesh and blood is grown so vile, my lord,
    That it doth hate what gets it.

EDGAR

    Poor Tom's a-cold.

GLOUCESTER

    Go in with me: my duty cannot suffer
    To obey in all your daughters' hard commands:
    Though their injunction be to bar my doors,
    And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,
    Yet have I ventured to come seek you out,
    And bring you where both fire and food is ready.

KING LEAR

    First let me talk with this philosopher.
    What is the cause of thunder?

KENT

    Good my lord, take his offer; go into the house.

KING LEAR

    I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.
    What is your study?

EDGAR

    How to prevent the fiend, and to kill vermin.

KING LEAR

    Let me ask you one word in private.

KENT

    Importune him once more to go, my lord;
    His wits begin to unsettle.

GLOUCESTER

    Canst thou blame him?

    Storm still
    His daughters seek his death: ah, that good Kent!
    He said it would be thus, poor banish'd man!
    Thou say'st the king grows mad; I'll tell thee, friend,
    I am almost mad myself: I had a son,
    Now outlaw'd from my blood; he sought my life,
    But lately, very late: I loved him, friend;
    No father his son dearer: truth to tell thee,
    The grief hath crazed my wits. What a night's this!
    I do beseech your grace,--

KING LEAR

    O, cry your mercy, sir.
    Noble philosopher, your company.

EDGAR

    Tom's a-cold.

GLOUCESTER

    In, fellow, there, into the hovel: keep thee warm.

KING LEAR

    Come let's in all.

KENT

    This way, my lord.

KING LEAR

    With him;
    I will keep still with my philosopher.

KENT

    Good my lord, soothe him; let him take the fellow.

GLOUCESTER

    Take him you on.

KENT

    Sirrah, come on; go along with us.

KING LEAR

    Come, good Athenian.

GLOUCESTER

    No words, no words: hush.

EDGAR

    Child Rowland to the dark tower came,
    His word was still,--Fie, foh, and fum,
    I smell the blood of a British man.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Gloucester's castle.

    Enter CORNWALL and EDMUND 

CORNWALL

    I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.

EDMUND

    How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus
    gives way to loyalty, something fears me to think
    of.

CORNWALL

    I now perceive, it was not altogether your
    brother's evil disposition made him seek his death;
    but a provoking merit, set a-work by a reprovable
    badness in himself.

EDMUND

    How malicious is my fortune, that I must repent to
    be just! This is the letter he spoke of, which
    approves him an intelligent party to the advantages
    of France: O heavens! that this treason were not,
    or not I the detector!

CORNWALL

    o with me to the duchess.

EDMUND

    If the matter of this paper be certain, you have
    mighty business in hand.

CORNWALL

    True or false, it hath made thee earl of
    Gloucester. Seek out where thy father is, that he
    may be ready for our apprehension.

EDMUND

    [Aside] If I find him comforting the king, it will
    stuff his suspicion more fully.--I will persevere in
    my course of loyalty, though the conflict be sore
    between that and my blood.

CORNWALL

    I will lay trust upon thee; and thou shalt find a
    dearer father in my love.

    Exeunt

SCENE VI. A chamber in a farmhouse adjoining the castle.

    Enter GLOUCESTER, KING LEAR, KENT, Fool, and EDGAR 

GLOUCESTER

    Here is better than the open air; take it
    thankfully. I will piece out the comfort with what
    addition I can: I will not be long from you.

KENT

    All the power of his wits have given way to his
    impatience: the gods reward your kindness!

    Exit GLOUCESTER

EDGAR

    Frateretto calls me; and tells me
    Nero is an angler in the lake of darkness.
    Pray, innocent, and beware the foul fiend.

Fool

    Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman be a
    gentleman or a yeoman?

KING LEAR

    A king, a king!

Fool

    No, he's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son;
    for he's a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman
    before him.

KING LEAR

    To have a thousand with red burning spits
    Come hissing in upon 'em,--

EDGAR

    The foul fiend bites my back.

Fool

    He's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a
    horse's health, a boy's love, or a whore's oath.

KING LEAR

    It shall be done; I will arraign them straight.

    To EDGAR
    Come, sit thou here, most learned justicer;

    To the Fool
    Thou, sapient sir, sit here. Now, you she foxes!

EDGAR

    Look, where he stands and glares!
    Wantest thou eyes at trial, madam?
    Come o'er the bourn, Bessy, to me,--

Fool

    Her boat hath a leak,
    And she must not speak
    Why she dares not come over to thee.

EDGAR

    The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of a
    nightingale. Hopdance cries in Tom's belly for two
    white herring. Croak not, black angel; I have no
    food for thee.

KENT

    How do you, sir? Stand you not so amazed:
    Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions?

KING LEAR

    I'll see their trial first. Bring in the evidence.

    To EDGAR
    Thou robed man of justice, take thy place;

    To the Fool
    And thou, his yoke-fellow of equity,
    Bench by his side:

    To KENT
    you are o' the commission,
    Sit you too.

EDGAR

    Let us deal justly.
    Sleepest or wakest thou, jolly shepherd?
    Thy sheep be in the corn;
    And for one blast of thy minikin mouth,
    Thy sheep shall take no harm.
    Pur! the cat is gray.

KING LEAR

    Arraign her first; 'tis Goneril. I here take my
    oath before this honourable assembly, she kicked the
    poor king her father.

Fool

    Come hither, mistress. Is your name Goneril?

KING LEAR

    She cannot deny it.

Fool

    Cry you mercy, I took you for a joint-stool.

KING LEAR

    And here's another, whose warp'd looks proclaim
    What store her heart is made on. Stop her there!
    Arms, arms, sword, fire! Corruption in the place!
    False justicer, why hast thou let her 'scape?

EDGAR

    Bless thy five wits!

KENT

    O pity! Sir, where is the patience now,
    That thou so oft have boasted to retain?

EDGAR

    [Aside] My tears begin to take his part so much,
    They'll mar my counterfeiting.

KING LEAR

    The little dogs and all, Tray, Blanch, and
    Sweet-heart, see, they bark at me.

EDGAR

    Tom will throw his head at them. Avaunt, you curs!
    Be thy mouth or black or white,
    Tooth that poisons if it bite;
    Mastiff, grey-hound, mongrel grim,
    Hound or spaniel, brach or lym,
    Or bobtail tike or trundle-tail,
    Tom will make them weep and wail:
    For, with throwing thus my head,
    Dogs leap the hatch, and all are fled.
    Do de, de, de. Sessa! Come, march to wakes and
    fairs and market-towns. Poor Tom, thy horn is dry.

KING LEAR

    Then let them anatomize Regan; see what breeds
    about her heart. Is there any cause in nature that
    makes these hard hearts?

    To EDGAR
    You, sir, I entertain for one of my hundred; only I
    do not like the fashion of your garments: you will
    say they are Persian attire: but let them be changed.

KENT

    Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.

KING LEAR

    Make no noise, make no noise; draw the curtains:
    so, so, so. We'll go to supper i' he morning. So, so, so.

Fool

    And I'll go to bed at noon.

    Re-enter GLOUCESTER

GLOUCESTER

    Come hither, friend: where is the king my master?

KENT

    Here, sir; but trouble him not, his wits are gone.

GLOUCESTER

    Good friend, I prithee, take him in thy arms;
    I have o'erheard a plot of death upon him:
    There is a litter ready; lay him in 't,
    And drive towards Dover, friend, where thou shalt meet
    Both welcome and protection. Take up thy master:
    If thou shouldst dally half an hour, his life,
    With thine, and all that offer to defend him,
    Stand in assured loss: take up, take up;
    And follow me, that will to some provision
    Give thee quick conduct.

KENT

    Oppressed nature sleeps:
    This rest might yet have balm'd thy broken senses,
    Which, if convenience will not allow,
    Stand in hard cure.

    To the Fool
    Come, help to bear thy master;
    Thou must not stay behind.

GLOUCESTER

    Come, come, away.

    Exeunt all but EDGAR

EDGAR

    When we our betters see bearing our woes,
    We scarcely think our miseries our foes.
    Who alone suffers suffers most i' the mind,
    Leaving free things and happy shows behind:
    But then the mind much sufferance doth o'er skip,
    When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship.
    How light and portable my pain seems now,
    When that which makes me bend makes the king bow,
    He childed as I father'd! Tom, away!
    Mark the high noises; and thyself bewray,
    When false opinion, whose wrong thought defiles thee,
    In thy just proof, repeals and reconciles thee.
    What will hap more to-night, safe 'scape the king!
    Lurk, lurk.

    Exit

SCENE VII. Gloucester's castle.

    Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, GONERIL, EDMUND, and Servants 

CORNWALL

    Post speedily to my lord your husband; show him
    this letter: the army of France is landed. Seek
    out the villain Gloucester.

    Exeunt some of the Servants

REGAN

    Hang him instantly.

GONERIL

    Pluck out his eyes.

CORNWALL

    Leave him to my displeasure. Edmund, keep you our
    sister company: the revenges we are bound to take
    upon your traitorous father are not fit for your
    beholding. Advise the duke, where you are going, to
    a most festinate preparation: we are bound to the
    like. Our posts shall be swift and intelligent
    betwixt us. Farewell, dear sister: farewell, my
    lord of Gloucester.

    Enter OSWALD
    How now! where's the king?

OSWALD

    My lord of Gloucester hath convey'd him hence:
    Some five or six and thirty of his knights,
    Hot questrists after him, met him at gate;
    Who, with some other of the lords dependants,
    Are gone with him towards Dover; where they boast
    To have well-armed friends.

CORNWALL

    Get horses for your mistress.

GONERIL

    Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.

CORNWALL

    Edmund, farewell.

    Exeunt GONERIL, EDMUND, and OSWALD
    Go seek the traitor Gloucester,
    Pinion him like a thief, bring him before us.

    Exeunt other Servants
    Though well we may not pass upon his life
    Without the form of justice, yet our power
    Shall do a courtesy to our wrath, which men
    May blame, but not control. Who's there? the traitor?

    Enter GLOUCESTER, brought in by two or three

REGAN

    Ingrateful fox! 'tis he.

CORNWALL

    Bind fast his corky arms.

GLOUCESTER

    What mean your graces? Good my friends, consider
    You are my guests: do me no foul play, friends.

CORNWALL

    Bind him, I say.

    Servants bind him

REGAN

    Hard, hard. O filthy traitor!

GLOUCESTER

    Unmerciful lady as you are, I'm none.

CORNWALL

    To this chair bind him. Villain, thou shalt find--

    REGAN plucks his beard

GLOUCESTER

    By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly done
    To pluck me by the beard.

REGAN

    So white, and such a traitor!

GLOUCESTER

    Naughty lady,
    These hairs, which thou dost ravish from my chin,
    Will quicken, and accuse thee: I am your host:
    With robbers' hands my hospitable favours
    You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?

CORNWALL

    Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?

REGAN

    Be simple answerer, for we know the truth.

CORNWALL

    And what confederacy have you with the traitors
    Late footed in the kingdom?

REGAN

    To whose hands have you sent the lunatic king? Speak.

GLOUCESTER

    I have a letter guessingly set down,
    Which came from one that's of a neutral heart,
    And not from one opposed.

CORNWALL

    Cunning.

REGAN

    And false.

CORNWALL

    Where hast thou sent the king?

GLOUCESTER

    To Dover.

REGAN

    Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charged at peril--

CORNWALL

    Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that.

GLOUCESTER

    I am tied to the stake, and I must stand the course.

REGAN

    Wherefore to Dover, sir?

GLOUCESTER

    Because I would not see thy cruel nails
    Pluck out his poor old eyes; nor thy fierce sister
    In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.
    The sea, with such a storm as his bare head
    In hell-black night endured, would have buoy'd up,
    And quench'd the stelled fires:
    Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.
    If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time,
    Thou shouldst have said 'Good porter, turn the key,'
    All cruels else subscribed: but I shall see
    The winged vengeance overtake such children.

CORNWALL

    See't shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair.
    Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.

GLOUCESTER

    He that will think to live till he be old,
    Give me some help! O cruel! O you gods!

REGAN

    One side will mock another; the other too.

CORNWALL

    If you see vengeance,--

First Servant

    Hold your hand, my lord:
    I have served you ever since I was a child;
    But better service have I never done you
    Than now to bid you hold.

REGAN

    How now, you dog!

First Servant

    If you did wear a beard upon your chin,
    I'd shake it on this quarrel. What do you mean?

CORNWALL

    My villain!

    They draw and fight

First Servant

    Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger.

REGAN

    Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus!

    Takes a sword, and runs at him behind

First Servant

    O, I am slain! My lord, you have one eye left
    To see some mischief on him. O!

    Dies

CORNWALL

    Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly!
    Where is thy lustre now?

GLOUCESTER

    All dark and comfortless. Where's my son Edmund?
    Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature,
    To quit this horrid act.

REGAN

    Out, treacherous villain!
    Thou call'st on him that hates thee: it was he
    That made the overture of thy treasons to us;
    Who is too good to pity thee.

GLOUCESTER

    O my follies! then Edgar was abused.
    Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him!

REGAN

    Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell
    His way to Dover.

    Exit one with GLOUCESTER
    How is't, my lord? how look you?

CORNWALL

    I have received a hurt: follow me, lady.
    Turn out that eyeless villain; throw this slave
    Upon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace:
    Untimely comes this hurt: give me your arm.

    Exit CORNWALL, led by REGAN

Second Servant

    I'll never care what wickedness I do,
    If this man come to good.

Third Servant

    If she live long,
    And in the end meet the old course of death,
    Women will all turn monsters.

Second Servant

    Let's follow the old earl, and get the Bedlam
    To lead him where he would: his roguish madness
    Allows itself to any thing.

Third Servant

    Go thou: I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs
    To apply to his bleeding face. Now, heaven help him!

    Exeunt severally

ACT IV
SCENE I. The heath.

    Enter EDGAR 

EDGAR

    Yet better thus, and known to be contemn'd,
    Than still contemn'd and flatter'd. To be worst,
    The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,
    Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear:
    The lamentable change is from the best;
    The worst returns to laughter. Welcome, then,
    Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace!
    The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst
    Owes nothing to thy blasts. But who comes here?

    Enter GLOUCESTER, led by an Old Man
    My father, poorly led? World, world, O world!
    But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,
    Lie would not yield to age.

Old Man

    O, my good lord, I have been your tenant, and
    your father's tenant, these fourscore years.

GLOUCESTER

    Away, get thee away; good friend, be gone:
    Thy comforts can do me no good at all;
    Thee they may hurt.

Old Man

    Alack, sir, you cannot see your way.

GLOUCESTER

    I have no way, and therefore want no eyes;
    I stumbled when I saw: full oft 'tis seen,
    Our means secure us, and our mere defects
    Prove our commodities. O dear son Edgar,
    The food of thy abused father's wrath!
    Might I but live to see thee in my touch,
    I'ld say I had eyes again!

Old Man

    How now! Who's there?

EDGAR

    [Aside] O gods! Who is't can say 'I am at
    the worst'?
    I am worse than e'er I was.

Old Man

    'Tis poor mad Tom.

EDGAR

    [Aside] And worse I may be yet: the worst is not
    So long as we can say 'This is the worst.'

Old Man

    Fellow, where goest?

GLOUCESTER

    Is it a beggar-man?

Old Man

    Madman and beggar too.

GLOUCESTER

    He has some reason, else he could not beg.
    I' the last night's storm I such a fellow saw;
    Which made me think a man a worm: my son
    Came then into my mind; and yet my mind
    Was then scarce friends with him: I have heard
    more since.
    As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods.
    They kill us for their sport.

EDGAR

    [Aside] How should this be?
    Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,
    Angering itself and others.--Bless thee, master!

GLOUCESTER

    Is that the naked fellow?

Old Man

    Ay, my lord.

GLOUCESTER

    Then, prithee, get thee gone: if, for my sake,
    Thou wilt o'ertake us, hence a mile or twain,
    I' the way toward Dover, do it for ancient love;
    And bring some covering for this naked soul,
    Who I'll entreat to lead me.

Old Man

    Alack, sir, he is mad.

GLOUCESTER

    'Tis the times' plague, when madmen lead the blind.
    Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure;
    Above the rest, be gone.

Old Man

    I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have,
    Come on't what will.

    Exit

GLOUCESTER

    Sirrah, naked fellow,--

EDGAR

    Poor Tom's a-cold.

    Aside
    I cannot daub it further.

GLOUCESTER

    Come hither, fellow.

EDGAR

    [Aside] And yet I must.--Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed.

GLOUCESTER

    Know'st thou the way to Dover?

EDGAR

    Both stile and gate, horse-way and foot-path. Poor
    Tom hath been scared out of his good wits: bless
    thee, good man's son, from the foul fiend! five
    fiends have been in poor Tom at once; of lust, as
    Obidicut; Hobbididence, prince of dumbness; Mahu, of
    stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of
    mopping and mowing, who since possesses chambermaids
    and waiting-women. So, bless thee, master!

GLOUCESTER

    Here, take this purse, thou whom the heavens' plagues
    Have humbled to all strokes: that I am wretched
    Makes thee the happier: heavens, deal so still!
    Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,
    That slaves your ordinance, that will not see
    Because he doth not feel, feel your power quickly;
    So distribution should undo excess,
    And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?

EDGAR

    Ay, master.

GLOUCESTER

    There is a cliff, whose high and bending head
    Looks fearfully in the confined deep:
    Bring me but to the very brim of it,
    And I'll repair the misery thou dost bear
    With something rich about me: from that place
    I shall no leading need.

EDGAR

    Give me thy arm:
    Poor Tom shall lead thee.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Before ALBANY's palace.

    Enter GONERIL and EDMUND 

GONERIL

    Welcome, my lord: I marvel our mild husband
    Not met us on the way.

    Enter OSWALD
    Now, where's your master'?

OSWALD

    Madam, within; but never man so changed.
    I told him of the army that was landed;
    He smiled at it: I told him you were coming:
    His answer was 'The worse:' of Gloucester's treachery,
    And of the loyal service of his son,
    When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot,
    And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out:
    What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;
    What like, offensive.

GONERIL

    [To EDMUND] Then shall you go no further.
    It is the cowish terror of his spirit,
    That dares not undertake: he'll not feel wrongs
    Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way
    May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;
    Hasten his musters and conduct his powers:
    I must change arms at home, and give the distaff
    Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant
    Shall pass between us: ere long you are like to hear,
    If you dare venture in your own behalf,
    A mistress's command. Wear this; spare speech;

    Giving a favour
    Decline your head: this kiss, if it durst speak,
    Would stretch thy spirits up into the air:
    Conceive, and fare thee well.

EDMUND

    Yours in the ranks of death.

GONERIL

    My most dear Gloucester!

    Exit EDMUND
    O, the difference of man and man!
    To thee a woman's services are due:
    My fool usurps my body.

OSWALD

    Madam, here comes my lord.

    Exit

    Enter ALBANY

GONERIL

    I have been worth the whistle.

ALBANY

    O Goneril!
    You are not worth the dust which the rude wind
    Blows in your face. I fear your disposition:
    That nature, which contemns its origin,
    Cannot be border'd certain in itself;
    She that herself will sliver and disbranch
    From her material sap, perforce must wither
    And come to deadly use.

GONERIL

    No more; the text is foolish.

ALBANY

    Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile:
    Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?
    Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?
    A father, and a gracious aged man,
    Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,
    Most barbarous, most degenerate! have you madded.
    Could my good brother suffer you to do it?
    A man, a prince, by him so benefited!
    If that the heavens do not their visible spirits
    Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,
    It will come,
    Humanity must perforce prey on itself,
    Like monsters of the deep.

GONERIL

    Milk-liver'd man!
    That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;
    Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
    Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know'st
    Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd
    Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
    France spreads his banners in our noiseless land;
    With plumed helm thy slayer begins threats;
    Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit'st still, and criest
    'Alack, why does he so?'

ALBANY

    See thyself, devil!
    Proper deformity seems not in the fiend
    So horrid as in woman.

GONERIL

    O vain fool!

ALBANY

    Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame,
    Be-monster not thy feature. Were't my fitness
    To let these hands obey my blood,
    They are apt enough to dislocate and tear
    Thy flesh and bones: howe'er thou art a fiend,
    A woman's shape doth shield thee.

GONERIL

    Marry, your manhood now--

    Enter a Messenger

ALBANY

    What news?

Messenger

    O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall's dead:
    Slain by his servant, going to put out
    The other eye of Gloucester.

ALBANY

    Gloucester's eye!

Messenger

    A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,
    Opposed against the act, bending his sword
    To his great master; who, thereat enraged,
    Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead;
    But not without that harmful stroke, which since
    Hath pluck'd him after.

ALBANY

    This shows you are above,
    You justicers, that these our nether crimes
    So speedily can venge! But, O poor Gloucester!
    Lost he his other eye?

Messenger

    Both, both, my lord.
    This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer;
    'Tis from your sister.

GONERIL

    [Aside] One way I like this well;
    But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,
    May all the building in my fancy pluck
    Upon my hateful life: another way,
    The news is not so tart.--I'll read, and answer.

    Exit

ALBANY

    Where was his son when they did take his eyes?

Messenger

    Come with my lady hither.

ALBANY

    He is not here.

Messenger

    No, my good lord; I met him back again.

ALBANY

    Knows he the wickedness?

Messenger

    Ay, my good lord; 'twas he inform'd against him;
    And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment
    Might have the freer course.

ALBANY

    Gloucester, I live
    To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the king,
    And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend:
    Tell me what more thou know'st.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. The French camp near Dover.

    Enter KENT and a Gentleman 

KENT

    Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back
    know you the reason?

Gentleman

    Something he left imperfect in the
    state, which since his coming forth is thought
    of; which imports to the kingdom so much
    fear and danger, that his personal return was
    most required and necessary.

KENT

    Who hath he left behind him general?

Gentleman

    The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.

KENT

    Did your letters pierce the queen to any
    demonstration of grief?

Gentleman

    Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence;
    And now and then an ample tear trill'd down
    Her delicate cheek: it seem'd she was a queen
    Over her passion; who, most rebel-like,
    Sought to be king o'er her.

KENT

    O, then it moved her.

Gentleman

    Not to a rage: patience and sorrow strove
    Who should express her goodliest. You have seen
    Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears
    Were like a better way: those happy smilets,
    That play'd on her ripe lip, seem'd not to know
    What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence,
    As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,
    Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved,
    If all could so become it.

KENT

    Made she no verbal question?

Gentleman

    'Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of 'father'
    Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart:
    Cried 'Sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!
    Kent! father! sisters! What, i' the storm? i' the night?
    Let pity not be believed!' There she shook
    The holy water from her heavenly eyes,
    And clamour moisten'd: then away she started
    To deal with grief alone.

KENT

    It is the stars,
    The stars above us, govern our conditions;
    Else one self mate and mate could not beget
    Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?

Gentleman

    No.

KENT

    Was this before the king return'd?

Gentleman

    No, since.

KENT

    Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' the town;
    Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers
    What we are come about, and by no means
    Will yield to see his daughter.

Gentleman

    Why, good sir?

KENT

    A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,
    That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her
    To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights
    To his dog-hearted daughters, these things sting
    His mind so venomously, that burning shame
    Detains him from Cordelia.

Gentleman

    Alack, poor gentleman!

KENT

    Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?

Gentleman

    'Tis so, they are afoot.

KENT

    Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear,
    And leave you to attend him: some dear cause
    Will in concealment wrap me up awhile;
    When I am known aright, you shall not grieve
    Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you, go
    Along with me.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. The same. A tent.

    Enter, with drum and colours, CORDELIA, Doctor, and Soldiers 

CORDELIA

    Alack, 'tis he: why, he was met even now
    As mad as the vex'd sea; singing aloud;
    Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,
    With bur-docks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,
    Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow
    In our sustaining corn. A century send forth;
    Search every acre in the high-grown field,
    And bring him to our eye.

    Exit an Officer
    What can man's wisdom
    In the restoring his bereaved sense?
    He that helps him take all my outward worth.

Doctor

    There is means, madam:
    Our foster-nurse of nature is repose,
    The which he lacks; that to provoke in him,
    Are many simples operative, whose power
    Will close the eye of anguish.

CORDELIA

    All blest secrets,
    All you unpublish'd virtues of the earth,
    Spring with my tears! be aidant and remediate
    In the good man's distress! Seek, seek for him;
    Lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the life
    That wants the means to lead it.

    Enter a Messenger

Messenger

    News, madam;
    The British powers are marching hitherward.

CORDELIA

    'Tis known before; our preparation stands
    In expectation of them. O dear father,
    It is thy business that I go about;
    Therefore great France
    My mourning and important tears hath pitied.
    No blown ambition doth our arms incite,
    But love, dear love, and our aged father's right:
    Soon may I hear and see him!

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Gloucester's castle.

    Enter REGAN and OSWALD 

REGAN

    But are my brother's powers set forth?

OSWALD

    Ay, madam.

REGAN

    Himself in person there?

OSWALD

    Madam, with much ado:
    Your sister is the better soldier.

REGAN

    Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?

OSWALD

    No, madam.

REGAN

    What might import my sister's letter to him?

OSWALD

    I know not, lady.

REGAN

    'Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.
    It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,
    To let him live: where he arrives he moves
    All hearts against us: Edmund, I think, is gone,
    In pity of his misery, to dispatch
    His nighted life: moreover, to descry
    The strength o' the enemy.

OSWALD

    I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.

REGAN

    Our troops set forth to-morrow: stay with us;
    The ways are dangerous.

OSWALD

    I may not, madam:
    My lady charged my duty in this business.

REGAN

    Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you
    Transport her purposes by word? Belike,
    Something--I know not what: I'll love thee much,
    Let me unseal the letter.

OSWALD

    Madam, I had rather--

REGAN

    I know your lady does not love her husband;
    I am sure of that: and at her late being here
    She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks
    To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.

OSWALD

    I, madam?

REGAN

    I speak in understanding; you are; I know't:
    Therefore I do advise you, take this note:
    My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd;
    And more convenient is he for my hand
    Than for your lady's: you may gather more.
    If you do find him, pray you, give him this;
    And when your mistress hears thus much from you,
    I pray, desire her call her wisdom to her.
    So, fare you well.
    If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,
    Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.

OSWALD

    Would I could meet him, madam! I should show
    What party I do follow.

REGAN

    Fare thee well.

    Exeunt

SCENE VI. Fields near Dover.

    Enter GLOUCESTER, and EDGAR dressed like a peasant 

GLOUCESTER

    When shall we come to the top of that same hill?

EDGAR

    You do climb up it now: look, how we labour.

GLOUCESTER

    Methinks the ground is even.

EDGAR

    Horrible steep.
    Hark, do you hear the sea?

GLOUCESTER

    No, truly.

EDGAR

    Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect
    By your eyes' anguish.

GLOUCESTER

    So may it be, indeed:
    Methinks thy voice is alter'd; and thou speak'st
    In better phrase and matter than thou didst.

EDGAR

    You're much deceived: in nothing am I changed
    But in my garments.

GLOUCESTER

    Methinks you're better spoken.

EDGAR

    Come on, sir; here's the place: stand still. How fearful
    And dizzy 'tis, to cast one's eyes so low!
    The crows and choughs that wing the midway air
    Show scarce so gross as beetles: half way down
    Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!
    Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:
    The fishermen, that walk upon the beach,
    Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,
    Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy
    Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge,
    That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes,
    Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more;
    Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight
    Topple down headlong.

GLOUCESTER

    Set me where you stand.

EDGAR

    Give me your hand: you are now within a foot
    Of the extreme verge: for all beneath the moon
    Would I not leap upright.

GLOUCESTER

    Let go my hand.
    Here, friend, 's another purse; in it a jewel
    Well worth a poor man's taking: fairies and gods
    Prosper it with thee! Go thou farther off;
    Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.

EDGAR

    Now fare you well, good sir.

GLOUCESTER

    With all my heart.

EDGAR

    Why I do trifle thus with his despair
    Is done to cure it.

GLOUCESTER

    [Kneeling] O you mighty gods!
    This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,
    Shake patiently my great affliction off:
    If I could bear it longer, and not fall
    To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,
    My snuff and loathed part of nature should
    Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!
    Now, fellow, fare thee well.

    He falls forward

EDGAR

    Gone, sir: farewell.
    And yet I know not how conceit may rob
    The treasury of life, when life itself
    Yields to the theft: had he been where he thought,
    By this, had thought been past. Alive or dead?
    Ho, you sir! friend! Hear you, sir! speak!
    Thus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.
    What are you, sir?

GLOUCESTER

    Away, and let me die.

EDGAR

    Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,
    So many fathom down precipitating,
    Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg: but thou dost breathe;
    Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.
    Ten masts at each make not the altitude
    Which thou hast perpendicularly fell:
    Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again.

GLOUCESTER

    But have I fall'n, or no?

EDGAR

    From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.
    Look up a-height; the shrill-gorged lark so far
    Cannot be seen or heard: do but look up.

GLOUCESTER

    Alack, I have no eyes.
    Is wretchedness deprived that benefit,
    To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort,
    When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage,
    And frustrate his proud will.

EDGAR

    Give me your arm:
    Up: so. How is 't? Feel you your legs? You stand.

GLOUCESTER

    Too well, too well.

EDGAR

    This is above all strangeness.
    Upon the crown o' the cliff, what thing was that
    Which parted from you?

GLOUCESTER

    A poor unfortunate beggar.

EDGAR

    As I stood here below, methought his eyes
    Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,
    Horns whelk'd and waved like the enridged sea:
    It was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,
    Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours
    Of men's impossibilities, have preserved thee.

GLOUCESTER

    I do remember now: henceforth I'll bear
    Affliction till it do cry out itself
    'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of,
    I took it for a man; often 'twould say
    'The fiend, the fiend:' he led me to that place.

EDGAR

    Bear free and patient thoughts. But who comes here?

    Enter KING LEAR, fantastically dressed with wild flowers
    The safer sense will ne'er accommodate
    His master thus.

KING LEAR

    No, they cannot touch me for coining; I am the
    king himself.

EDGAR

    O thou side-piercing sight!

KING LEAR

    Nature's above art in that respect. There's your
    press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a
    crow-keeper: draw me a clothier's yard. Look,
    look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this piece of toasted
    cheese will do 't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove
    it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well
    flown, bird! i' the clout, i' the clout: hewgh!
    Give the word.

EDGAR

    Sweet marjoram.

KING LEAR

    Pass.

GLOUCESTER

    I know that voice.

KING LEAR

    Ha! Goneril, with a white beard! They flattered
    me like a dog; and told me I had white hairs in my
    beard ere the black ones were there. To say 'ay'
    and 'no' to every thing that I said!--'Ay' and 'no'
    too was no good divinity. When the rain came to
    wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter; when
    the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I
    found 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go to, they are
    not men o' their words: they told me I was every
    thing; 'tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.

GLOUCESTER

    The trick of that voice I do well remember:
    Is 't not the king?

KING LEAR

    Ay, every inch a king:
    When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.
    I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause? Adultery?
    Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:
    The wren goes to 't, and the small gilded fly
    Does lecher in my sight.
    Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son
    Was kinder to his father than my daughters
    Got 'tween the lawful sheets.
    To 't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.
    Behold yond simpering dame,
    Whose face between her forks presages snow;
    That minces virtue, and does shake the head
    To hear of pleasure's name;
    The fitchew, nor the soiled horse, goes to 't
    With a more riotous appetite.
    Down from the waist they are Centaurs,
    Though women all above:
    But to the girdle do the gods inherit,
    Beneath is all the fiends';
    There's hell, there's darkness, there's the
    sulphurous pit,
    Burning, scalding, stench, consumption; fie,
    fie, fie! pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet,
    good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination:
    there's money for thee.

GLOUCESTER

    O, let me kiss that hand!

KING LEAR

    Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.

GLOUCESTER

    O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world
    Shall so wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?

KING LEAR

    I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny
    at me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'll not
    love. Read thou this challenge; mark but the
    penning of it.

GLOUCESTER

    Were all the letters suns, I could not see one.

EDGAR

    I would not take this from report; it is,
    And my heart breaks at it.

KING LEAR

    Read.

GLOUCESTER

    What, with the case of eyes?

KING LEAR

    O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your
    head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in
    a heavy case, your purse in a light; yet you see how
    this world goes.

GLOUCESTER

    I see it feelingly.

KING LEAR

    What, art mad? A man may see how this world goes
    with no eyes. Look with thine ears: see how yond
    justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark, in
    thine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, which
    is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen
    a farmer's dog bark at a beggar?

GLOUCESTER

    Ay, sir.

KING LEAR

    And the creature run from the cur? There thou
    mightst behold the great image of authority: a
    dog's obeyed in office.
    Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!
    Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;
    Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind
    For which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.
    Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;
    Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
    And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks:
    Arm it in rags, a pigmy's straw does pierce it.
    None does offend, none, I say, none; I'll able 'em:
    Take that of me, my friend, who have the power
    To seal the accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes;
    And like a scurvy politician, seem
    To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now:
    Pull off my boots: harder, harder: so.

EDGAR

    O, matter and impertinency mix'd! Reason in madness!

KING LEAR

    If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.
    I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester:
    Thou must be patient; we came crying hither:
    Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air,
    We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.

GLOUCESTER

    Alack, alack the day!

KING LEAR

    When we are born, we cry that we are come
    To this great stage of fools: this a good block;
    It were a delicate stratagem, to shoe
    A troop of horse with felt: I'll put 't in proof;
    And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,
    Then, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!

    Enter a Gentleman, with Attendants

Gentleman

    O, here he is: lay hand upon him. Sir,
    Your most dear daughter--

KING LEAR

    No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even
    The natural fool of fortune. Use me well;
    You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;
    I am cut to the brains.

Gentleman

    You shall have any thing.

KING LEAR

    No seconds? all myself?
    Why, this would make a man a man of salt,
    To use his eyes for garden water-pots,
    Ay, and laying autumn's dust.

Gentleman

    Good sir,--

KING LEAR

    I will die bravely, like a bridegroom. What!
    I will be jovial: come, come; I am a king,
    My masters, know you that.

Gentleman

    You are a royal one, and we obey you.

KING LEAR

    Then there's life in't. Nay, if you get it, you
    shall get it with running. Sa, sa, sa, sa.

    Exit running; Attendants follow

Gentleman

    A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,
    Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter,
    Who redeems nature from the general curse
    Which twain have brought her to.

EDGAR

    Hail, gentle sir.

Gentleman

    Sir, speed you: what's your will?

EDGAR

    Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?

Gentleman

    Most sure and vulgar: every one hears that,
    Which can distinguish sound.

EDGAR

    But, by your favour,
    How near's the other army?

Gentleman

    Near and on speedy foot; the main descry
    Stands on the hourly thought.

EDGAR

    I thank you, sir: that's all.

Gentleman

    Though that the queen on special cause is here,
    Her army is moved on.

EDGAR

    I thank you, sir.

    Exit Gentleman

GLOUCESTER

    You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me:
    Let not my worser spirit tempt me again
    To die before you please!

EDGAR

    Well pray you, father.

GLOUCESTER

    Now, good sir, what are you?

EDGAR

    A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows;
    Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,
    Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand,
    I'll lead you to some biding.

GLOUCESTER

    Hearty thanks:
    The bounty and the benison of heaven
    To boot, and boot!

    Enter OSWALD

OSWALD

    A proclaim'd prize! Most happy!
    That eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh
    To raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor,
    Briefly thyself remember: the sword is out
    That must destroy thee.

GLOUCESTER

    Now let thy friendly hand
    Put strength enough to't.

    EDGAR interposes

OSWALD

    Wherefore, bold peasant,
    Darest thou support a publish'd traitor? Hence;
    Lest that the infection of his fortune take
    Like hold on thee. Let go his arm.

EDGAR

    Ch'ill not let go, zir, without vurther 'casion.

OSWALD

    Let go, slave, or thou diest!

EDGAR

    Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor volk
    pass. An chud ha' bin zwaggered out of my life,
    'twould not ha' bin zo long as 'tis by a vortnight.
    Nay, come not near th' old man; keep out, che vor
    ye, or ise try whether your costard or my ballow be
    the harder: ch'ill be plain with you.

OSWALD

    Out, dunghill!

EDGAR

    Ch'ill pick your teeth, zir: come; no matter vor
    your foins.

    They fight, and EDGAR knocks him down

OSWALD

    Slave, thou hast slain me: villain, take my purse:
    If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body;
    And give the letters which thou find'st about me
    To Edmund earl of Gloucester; seek him out
    Upon the British party: O, untimely death!

    Dies

EDGAR

    I know thee well: a serviceable villain;
    As duteous to the vices of thy mistress
    As badness would desire.

GLOUCESTER

    What, is he dead?

EDGAR

    Sit you down, father; rest you
    Let's see these pockets: the letters that he speaks of
    May be my friends. He's dead; I am only sorry
    He had no other death's-man. Let us see:
    Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not:
    To know our enemies' minds, we'ld rip their hearts;
    Their papers, is more lawful.

    Reads
    'Let our reciprocal vows be remembered. You have
    many opportunities to cut him off: if your will
    want not, time and place will be fruitfully offered.
    There is nothing done, if he return the conqueror:
    then am I the prisoner, and his bed my goal; from
    the loathed warmth whereof deliver me, and supply
    the place for your labour.
    'Your--wife, so I would say--
    'Affectionate servant,
    'GONERIL.'
    O undistinguish'd space of woman's will!
    A plot upon her virtuous husband's life;
    And the exchange my brother! Here, in the sands,
    Thee I'll rake up, the post unsanctified
    Of murderous lechers: and in the mature time
    With this ungracious paper strike the sight
    Of the death practised duke: for him 'tis well
    That of thy death and business I can tell.

GLOUCESTER

    The king is mad: how stiff is my vile sense,
    That I stand up, and have ingenious feeling
    Of my huge sorrows! Better I were distract:
    So should my thoughts be sever'd from my griefs,
    And woes by wrong imaginations lose
    The knowledge of themselves.

EDGAR

    Give me your hand:

    Drum afar off
    Far off, methinks, I hear the beaten drum:
    Come, father, I'll bestow you with a friend.

    Exeunt

SCENE VII. A tent in the French camp. LEAR on a bed asleep,

    soft music playing; Gentleman, and others attending.

    Enter CORDELIA, KENT, and Doctor

CORDELIA

    O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work,
    To match thy goodness? My life will be too short,
    And every measure fail me.

KENT

    To be acknowledged, madam, is o'erpaid.
    All my reports go with the modest truth;
    Nor more nor clipp'd, but so.

CORDELIA

    Be better suited:
    These weeds are memories of those worser hours:
    I prithee, put them off.

KENT

    Pardon me, dear madam;
    Yet to be known shortens my made intent:
    My boon I make it, that you know me not
    Till time and I think meet.

CORDELIA

    Then be't so, my good lord.

    To the Doctor
    How does the king?

Doctor

    Madam, sleeps still.

CORDELIA

    O you kind gods,
    Cure this great breach in his abused nature!
    The untuned and jarring senses, O, wind up
    Of this child-changed father!

Doctor

    So please your majesty
    That we may wake the king: he hath slept long.

CORDELIA

    Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceed
    I' the sway of your own will. Is he array'd?

Gentleman

    Ay, madam; in the heaviness of his sleep
    We put fresh garments on him.

Doctor

    Be by, good madam, when we do awake him;
    I doubt not of his temperance.

CORDELIA

    Very well.

Doctor

    Please you, draw near. Louder the music there!

CORDELIA

    O my dear father! Restoration hang
    Thy medicine on my lips; and let this kiss
    Repair those violent harms that my two sisters
    Have in thy reverence made!

KENT

    Kind and dear princess!

CORDELIA

    Had you not been their father, these white flakes
    Had challenged pity of them. Was this a face
    To be opposed against the warring winds?
    To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?
    In the most terrible and nimble stroke
    Of quick, cross lightning? to watch--poor perdu!--
    With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog,
    Though he had bit me, should have stood that night
    Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father,
    To hovel thee with swine, and rogues forlorn,
    In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!
    'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
    Had not concluded all. He wakes; speak to him.

Doctor

    Madam, do you; 'tis fittest.

CORDELIA

    How does my royal lord? How fares your majesty?

KING LEAR

    You do me wrong to take me out o' the grave:
    Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound
    Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears
    Do scald like moulten lead.

CORDELIA

    Sir, do you know me?

KING LEAR

    You are a spirit, I know: when did you die?

CORDELIA

    Still, still, far wide!

Doctor

    He's scarce awake: let him alone awhile.

KING LEAR

    Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight?
    I am mightily abused. I should e'en die with pity,
    To see another thus. I know not what to say.
    I will not swear these are my hands: let's see;
    I feel this pin prick. Would I were assured
    Of my condition!

CORDELIA

    O, look upon me, sir,
    And hold your hands in benediction o'er me:
    No, sir, you must not kneel.

KING LEAR

    Pray, do not mock me:
    I am a very foolish fond old man,
    Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;
    And, to deal plainly,
    I fear I am not in my perfect mind.
    Methinks I should know you, and know this man;
    Yet I am doubtful for I am mainly ignorant
    What place this is; and all the skill I have
    Remembers not these garments; nor I know not
    Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;
    For, as I am a man, I think this lady
    To be my child Cordelia.

CORDELIA

    And so I am, I am.

KING LEAR

    Be your tears wet? yes, 'faith. I pray, weep not:
    If you have poison for me, I will drink it.
    I know you do not love me; for your sisters
    Have, as I do remember, done me wrong:
    You have some cause, they have not.

CORDELIA

    No cause, no cause.

KING LEAR

    Am I in France?

KENT

    In your own kingdom, sir.

KING LEAR

    Do not abuse me.

Doctor

    Be comforted, good madam: the great rage,
    You see, is kill'd in him: and yet it is danger
    To make him even o'er the time he has lost.
    Desire him to go in; trouble him no more
    Till further settling.

CORDELIA

    Will't please your highness walk?

KING LEAR

    You must bear with me:
    Pray you now, forget and forgive: I am old and foolish.

    Exeunt all but KENT and Gentleman

Gentleman

    Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain?

KENT

    Most certain, sir.

Gentleman

    Who is conductor of his people?

KENT

    As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.

Gentleman

    They say Edgar, his banished son, is with the Earl
    of Kent in Germany.

KENT

    Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about; the
    powers of the kingdom approach apace.

Gentleman

    The arbitrement is like to be bloody. Fare you
    well, sir.

    Exit

KENT

    My point and period will be throughly wrought,
    Or well or ill, as this day's battle's fought.

    Exit

ACT V
SCENE I. The British camp, near Dover.

    Enter, with drum and colours, EDMUND, REGAN, Gentlemen, and Soldiers. 

EDMUND

    Know of the duke if his last purpose hold,
    Or whether since he is advised by aught
    To change the course: he's full of alteration
    And self-reproving: bring his constant pleasure.

    To a Gentleman, who goes out

REGAN

    Our sister's man is certainly miscarried.

EDMUND

    'Tis to be doubted, madam.

REGAN

    Now, sweet lord,
    You know the goodness I intend upon you:
    Tell me--but truly--but then speak the truth,
    Do you not love my sister?

EDMUND

    In honour'd love.

REGAN

    But have you never found my brother's way
    To the forfended place?

EDMUND

    That thought abuses you.

REGAN

    I am doubtful that you have been conjunct
    And bosom'd with her, as far as we call hers.

EDMUND

    No, by mine honour, madam.

REGAN

    I never shall endure her: dear my lord,
    Be not familiar with her.

EDMUND

    Fear me not:
    She and the duke her husband!

    Enter, with drum and colours, ALBANY, GONERIL, and Soldiers

GONERIL

    [Aside] I had rather lose the battle than that sister
    Should loosen him and me.

ALBANY

    Our very loving sister, well be-met.
    Sir, this I hear; the king is come to his daughter,
    With others whom the rigor of our state
    Forced to cry out. Where I could not be honest,
    I never yet was valiant: for this business,
    It toucheth us, as France invades our land,
    Not bolds the king, with others, whom, I fear,
    Most just and heavy causes make oppose.

EDMUND

    Sir, you speak nobly.

REGAN

    Why is this reason'd?

GONERIL

    Combine together 'gainst the enemy;
    For these domestic and particular broils
    Are not the question here.

ALBANY

    Let's then determine
    With the ancient of war on our proceedings.

EDMUND

    I shall attend you presently at your tent.

REGAN

    Sister, you'll go with us?

GONERIL

    No.

REGAN

    'Tis most convenient; pray you, go with us.

GONERIL

    [Aside] O, ho, I know the riddle.--I will go.

    As they are going out, enter EDGAR disguised

EDGAR

    If e'er your grace had speech with man so poor,
    Hear me one word.

ALBANY

    I'll overtake you. Speak.

    Exeunt all but ALBANY and EDGAR

EDGAR

    Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.
    If you have victory, let the trumpet sound
    For him that brought it: wretched though I seem,
    I can produce a champion that will prove
    What is avouched there. If you miscarry,
    Your business of the world hath so an end,
    And machination ceases. Fortune love you.

ALBANY

    Stay till I have read the letter.

EDGAR

    I was forbid it.
    When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,
    And I'll appear again.

ALBANY

    Why, fare thee well: I will o'erlook thy paper.

    Exit EDGAR

    Re-enter EDMUND

EDMUND

    The enemy's in view; draw up your powers.
    Here is the guess of their true strength and forces
    By diligent discovery; but your haste
    Is now urged on you.

ALBANY

    We will greet the time.

    Exit

EDMUND

    To both these sisters have I sworn my love;
    Each jealous of the other, as the stung
    Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?
    Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy'd,
    If both remain alive: to take the widow
    Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;
    And hardly shall I carry out my side,
    Her husband being alive. Now then we'll use
    His countenance for the battle; which being done,
    Let her who would be rid of him devise
    His speedy taking off. As for the mercy
    Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia,
    The battle done, and they within our power,
    Shall never see his pardon; for my state
    Stands on me to defend, not to debate.

    Exit

SCENE II. A field between the two camps.

    Alarum within. Enter, with drum and colours, KING LEAR, CORDELIA, and Soldiers, over the stage; and exeunt 

    Enter EDGAR and GLOUCESTER 

EDGAR

    Here, father, take the shadow of this tree
    For your good host; pray that the right may thrive:
    If ever I return to you again,
    I'll bring you comfort.

GLOUCESTER

    Grace go with you, sir!

    Exit EDGAR

    Alarum and retreat within. Re-enter EDGAR

EDGAR

    Away, old man; give me thy hand; away!
    King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en:
    Give me thy hand; come on.

GLOUCESTER

    No farther, sir; a man may rot even here.

EDGAR

    What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure
    Their going hence, even as their coming hither;
    Ripeness is all: come on.

GLOUCESTER

    And that's true too.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. The British camp near Dover.

    Enter, in conquest, with drum and colours, EDMUND, KING LEAR and CORDELIA, prisoners; Captain, Soldiers, & c 

EDMUND

    Some officers take them away: good guard,
    Until their greater pleasures first be known
    That are to censure them.

CORDELIA

    We are not the first
    Who, with best meaning, have incurr'd the worst.
    For thee, oppressed king, am I cast down;
    Myself could else out-frown false fortune's frown.
    Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?

KING LEAR

    No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison:
    We two alone will sing like birds i' the cage:
    When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down,
    And ask of thee forgiveness: so we'll live,
    And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh
    At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues
    Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too,
    Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out;
    And take upon's the mystery of things,
    As if we were God's spies: and we'll wear out,
    In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones,
    That ebb and flow by the moon.

EDMUND

    Take them away.

KING LEAR

    Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,
    The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?
    He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven,
    And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes;
    The good-years shall devour them, flesh and fell,
    Ere they shall make us weep: we'll see 'em starve
    first. Come.

    Exeunt KING LEAR and CORDELIA, guarded

EDMUND

    Come hither, captain; hark.
    Take thou this note;

    Giving a paper
    go follow them to prison:
    One step I have advanced thee; if thou dost
    As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way
    To noble fortunes: know thou this, that men
    Are as the time is: to be tender-minded
    Does not become a sword: thy great employment
    Will not bear question; either say thou'lt do 't,
    Or thrive by other means.

Captain

    I'll do 't, my lord.

EDMUND

    About it; and write happy when thou hast done.
    Mark, I say, instantly; and carry it so
    As I have set it down.

Captain

    I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;
    If it be man's work, I'll do 't.

    Exit

    Flourish. Enter ALBANY, GONERIL, REGAN, another Captain, and Soldiers

ALBANY

    Sir, you have shown to-day your valiant strain,
    And fortune led you well: you have the captives
    That were the opposites of this day's strife:
    We do require them of you, so to use them
    As we shall find their merits and our safety
    May equally determine.

EDMUND

    Sir, I thought it fit
    To send the old and miserable king
    To some retention and appointed guard;
    Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,
    To pluck the common bosom on his side,
    An turn our impress'd lances in our eyes
    Which do command them. With him I sent the queen;
    My reason all the same; and they are ready
    To-morrow, or at further space, to appear
    Where you shall hold your session. At this time
    We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;
    And the best quarrels, in the heat, are cursed
    By those that feel their sharpness:
    The question of Cordelia and her father
    Requires a fitter place.

ALBANY

    Sir, by your patience,
    I hold you but a subject of this war,
    Not as a brother.

REGAN

    That's as we list to grace him.
    Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded,
    Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers;
    Bore the commission of my place and person;
    The which immediacy may well stand up,
    And call itself your brother.

GONERIL

    Not so hot:
    In his own grace he doth exalt himself,
    More than in your addition.

REGAN

    In my rights,
    By me invested, he compeers the best.

GONERIL

    That were the most, if he should husband you.

REGAN

    Jesters do oft prove prophets.

GONERIL

    Holla, holla!
    That eye that told you so look'd but a-squint.

REGAN

    Lady, I am not well; else I should answer
    From a full-flowing stomach. General,
    Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;
    Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine:
    Witness the world, that I create thee here
    My lord and master.

GONERIL

    Mean you to enjoy him?

ALBANY

    The let-alone lies not in your good will.

EDMUND

    Nor in thine, lord.

ALBANY

    Half-blooded fellow, yes.

REGAN

    [To EDMUND] Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.

ALBANY

    Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund, I arrest thee
    On capital treason; and, in thine attaint,
    This gilded serpent

    Pointing to Goneril
    For your claim, fair sister,
    I bar it in the interest of my wife:
    'Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord,
    And I, her husband, contradict your bans.
    If you will marry, make your loves to me,
    My lady is bespoke.

GONERIL

    An interlude!

ALBANY

    Thou art arm'd, Gloucester: let the trumpet sound:
    If none appear to prove upon thy head
    Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,
    There is my pledge;

    Throwing down a glove
    I'll prove it on thy heart,
    Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
    Than I have here proclaim'd thee.

REGAN

    Sick, O, sick!

GONERIL

    [Aside] If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.

EDMUND

    There's my exchange:

    Throwing down a glove
    what in the world he is
    That names me traitor, villain-like he lies:
    Call by thy trumpet: he that dares approach,
    On him, on you, who not? I will maintain
    My truth and honour firmly.

ALBANY

    A herald, ho!

EDMUND

    A herald, ho, a herald!

ALBANY

    Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,
    All levied in my name, have in my name
    Took their discharge.

REGAN

    My sickness grows upon me.

ALBANY

    She is not well; convey her to my tent.

    Exit Regan, led

    Enter a Herald
    Come hither, herald,--Let the trumpet sound,
    And read out this.

Captain

    Sound, trumpet!

    A trumpet sounds

Herald

    [Reads] 'If any man of quality or degree within
    the lists of the army will maintain upon Edmund,
    supposed Earl of Gloucester, that he is a manifold
    traitor, let him appear by the third sound of the
    trumpet: he is bold in his defence.'

EDMUND

    Sound!

    First trumpet

Herald

    Again!

    Second trumpet

Herald

    Again!

    Third trumpet

    Trumpet answers within

    Enter EDGAR, at the third sound, armed, with a trumpet before him

ALBANY

    Ask him his purposes, why he appears
    Upon this call o' the trumpet.

Herald

    What are you?
    Your name, your quality? and why you answer
    This present summons?

EDGAR

    Know, my name is lost;
    By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit:
    Yet am I noble as the adversary
    I come to cope.

ALBANY

    Which is that adversary?

EDGAR

    What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?

EDMUND

    Himself: what say'st thou to him?

EDGAR

    Draw thy sword,
    That, if my speech offend a noble heart,
    Thy arm may do thee justice: here is mine.
    Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours,
    My oath, and my profession: I protest,
    Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,
    Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,
    Thy valour and thy heart, thou art a traitor;
    False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;
    Conspirant 'gainst this high-illustrious prince;
    And, from the extremest upward of thy head
    To the descent and dust below thy foot,
    A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'No,'
    This sword, this arm, and my best spirits, are bent
    To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,
    Thou liest.

EDMUND

    In wisdom I should ask thy name;
    But, since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,
    And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,
    What safe and nicely I might well delay
    By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn:
    Back do I toss these treasons to thy head;
    With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart;
    Which, for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise,
    This sword of mine shall give them instant way,
    Where they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!

    Alarums. They fight. EDMUND falls

ALBANY

    Save him, save him!

GONERIL

    This is practise, Gloucester:
    By the law of arms thou wast not bound to answer
    An unknown opposite; thou art not vanquish'd,
    But cozen'd and beguiled.

ALBANY

    Shut your mouth, dame,
    Or with this paper shall I stop it: Hold, sir:
    Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil:
    No tearing, lady: I perceive you know it.

    Gives the letter to EDMUND

GONERIL

    Say, if I do, the laws are mine, not thine:
    Who can arraign me for't.

ALBANY

    Most monstrous! oh!
    Know'st thou this paper?

GONERIL

    Ask me not what I know.

    Exit

ALBANY

    Go after her: she's desperate; govern her.

EDMUND

    What you have charged me with, that have I done;
    And more, much more; the time will bring it out:
    'Tis past, and so am I. But what art thou
    That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,
    I do forgive thee.

EDGAR

    Let's exchange charity.
    I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;
    If more, the more thou hast wrong'd me.
    My name is Edgar, and thy father's son.
    The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices
    Make instruments to plague us:
    The dark and vicious place where thee he got
    Cost him his eyes.

EDMUND

    Thou hast spoken right, 'tis true;
    The wheel is come full circle: I am here.

ALBANY

    Methought thy very gait did prophesy
    A royal nobleness: I must embrace thee:
    Let sorrow split my heart, if ever I
    Did hate thee or thy father!

EDGAR

    Worthy prince, I know't.

ALBANY

    Where have you hid yourself?
    How have you known the miseries of your father?

EDGAR

    By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;
    And when 'tis told, O, that my heart would burst!
    The bloody proclamation to escape,
    That follow'd me so near,--O, our lives' sweetness!
    That we the pain of death would hourly die
    Rather than die at once!--taught me to shift
    Into a madman's rags; to assume a semblance
    That very dogs disdain'd: and in this habit
    Met I my father with his bleeding rings,
    Their precious stones new lost: became his guide,
    Led him, begg'd for him, saved him from despair;
    Never,--O fault!--reveal'd myself unto him,
    Until some half-hour past, when I was arm'd:
    Not sure, though hoping, of this good success,
    I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last
    Told him my pilgrimage: but his flaw'd heart,
    Alack, too weak the conflict to support!
    'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,
    Burst smilingly.

EDMUND

    This speech of yours hath moved me,
    And shall perchance do good: but speak you on;
    You look as you had something more to say.

ALBANY

    If there be more, more woeful, hold it in;
    For I am almost ready to dissolve,
    Hearing of this.

EDGAR

    This would have seem'd a period
    To such as love not sorrow; but another,
    To amplify too much, would make much more,
    And top extremity.
    Whilst I was big in clamour came there in a man,
    Who, having seen me in my worst estate,
    Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding
    Who 'twas that so endured, with his strong arms
    He fastened on my neck, and bellow'd out
    As he'ld burst heaven; threw him on my father;
    Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
    That ever ear received: which in recounting
    His grief grew puissant and the strings of life
    Began to crack: twice then the trumpets sounded,
    And there I left him tranced.

ALBANY

    But who was this?

EDGAR

    Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
    Follow'd his enemy king, and did him service
    Improper for a slave.

    Enter a Gentleman, with a bloody knife

Gentleman

    Help, help, O, help!

EDGAR

    What kind of help?

ALBANY

    Speak, man.

EDGAR

    What means that bloody knife?

Gentleman

    'Tis hot, it smokes;
    It came even from the heart of--O, she's dead!

ALBANY

    Who dead? speak, man.

Gentleman

    Your lady, sir, your lady: and her sister
    By her is poisoned; she hath confess'd it.

EDMUND

    I was contracted to them both: all three
    Now marry in an instant.

EDGAR

    Here comes Kent.

ALBANY

    Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead:
    This judgment of the heavens, that makes us tremble,
    Touches us not with pity.

    Exit Gentleman

    Enter KENT
    O, is this he?
    The time will not allow the compliment
    Which very manners urges.

KENT

    I am come
    To bid my king and master aye good night:
    Is he not here?

ALBANY

    Great thing of us forgot!
    Speak, Edmund, where's the king? and where's Cordelia?
    See'st thou this object, Kent?

    The bodies of GONERIL and REGAN are brought in

KENT

    Alack, why thus?

EDMUND

    Yet Edmund was beloved:
    The one the other poison'd for my sake,
    And after slew herself.

ALBANY

    Even so. Cover their faces.

EDMUND

    I pant for life: some good I mean to do,
    Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send,
    Be brief in it, to the castle; for my writ
    Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia:
    Nay, send in time.

ALBANY

    Run, run, O, run!

EDGAR

    To who, my lord? Who hath the office? send
    Thy token of reprieve.

EDMUND

    Well thought on: take my sword,
    Give it the captain.

ALBANY

    Haste thee, for thy life.

    Exit EDGAR

EDMUND

    He hath commission from thy wife and me
    To hang Cordelia in the prison, and
    To lay the blame upon her own despair,
    That she fordid herself.

ALBANY

    The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.

    EDMUND is borne off

    Re-enter KING LEAR, with CORDELIA dead in his arms; EDGAR, Captain, and others following

KING LEAR

    Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stones:
    Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so
    That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever!
    I know when one is dead, and when one lives;
    She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking-glass;
    If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,
    Why, then she lives.

KENT

    Is this the promised end

EDGAR

    Or image of that horror?

ALBANY

    Fall, and cease!

KING LEAR

    This feather stirs; she lives! if it be so,
    It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows
    That ever I have felt.

KENT

    [Kneeling] O my good master!

KING LEAR

    Prithee, away.

EDGAR

    'Tis noble Kent, your friend.

KING LEAR

    A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!
    I might have saved her; now she's gone for ever!
    Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!
    What is't thou say'st? Her voice was ever soft,
    Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.
    I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.

Captain

    'Tis true, my lords, he did.

KING LEAR

    Did I not, fellow?
    I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion
    I would have made them skip: I am old now,
    And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?
    Mine eyes are not o' the best: I'll tell you straight.

KENT

    If fortune brag of two she loved and hated,
    One of them we behold.

KING LEAR

    This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?

KENT

    The same,
    Your servant Kent: Where is your servant Caius?

KING LEAR

    He's a good fellow, I can tell you that;
    He'll strike, and quickly too: he's dead and rotten.

KENT

    No, my good lord; I am the very man,--

KING LEAR

    I'll see that straight.

KENT

    That, from your first of difference and decay,
    Have follow'd your sad steps.

KING LEAR

    You are welcome hither.

KENT

    Nor no man else: all's cheerless, dark, and deadly.
    Your eldest daughters have fordone them selves,
    And desperately are dead.

KING LEAR

    Ay, so I think.

ALBANY

    He knows not what he says: and vain it is
    That we present us to him.

EDGAR

    Very bootless.

    Enter a Captain

Captain

    Edmund is dead, my lord.

ALBANY

    That's but a trifle here.
    You lords and noble friends, know our intent.
    What comfort to this great decay may come
    Shall be applied: for us we will resign,
    During the life of this old majesty,
    To him our absolute power:

    To EDGAR and KENT
    you, to your rights:
    With boot, and such addition as your honours
    Have more than merited. All friends shall taste
    The wages of their virtue, and all foes
    The cup of their deservings. O, see, see!

KING LEAR

    And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!
    Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,
    And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,
    Never, never, never, never, never!
    Pray you, undo this button: thank you, sir.
    Do you see this? Look on her, look, her lips,
    Look there, look there!

    Dies

EDGAR

    He faints! My lord, my lord!

KENT

    Break, heart; I prithee, break!

EDGAR

    Look up, my lord.

KENT

    Vex not his ghost: O, let him pass! he hates him much
    That would upon the rack of this tough world
    Stretch him out longer.

EDGAR

    He is gone, indeed.

KENT

    The wonder is, he hath endured so long:
    He but usurp'd his life.

ALBANY

    Bear them from hence. Our present business
    Is general woe.

    To KENT and EDGAR
    Friends of my soul, you twain
    Rule in this realm, and the gored state sustain.

KENT

    I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;
    My master calls me, I must not say no.

ALBANY

    The weight of this sad time we must obey;
    Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
    The oldest hath borne most: we that are young
    Shall never see so much, nor live so long.

    Exeunt, with a dead march


ACT I
SCENE I. A desert place.

    Thunder and lightning. Enter three Witches 

First Witch

    When shall we three meet again
    In thunder, lightning, or in rain?

Second Witch

    When the hurlyburly's done,
    When the battle's lost and won.

Third Witch

    That will be ere the set of sun.

First Witch

    Where the place?

Second Witch

    Upon the heath.

Third Witch

    There to meet with Macbeth.

First Witch

    I come, Graymalkin!

Second Witch

    Paddock calls.

Third Witch

    Anon.

ALL

    Fair is foul, and foul is fair:
    Hover through the fog and filthy air.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A camp near Forres.

    Alarum within. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, LENNOX, with Attendants, meeting a bleeding Sergeant 

DUNCAN

    What bloody man is that? He can report,
    As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
    The newest state.

MALCOLM

    This is the sergeant
    Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
    'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!
    Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
    As thou didst leave it.

Sergeant

    Doubtful it stood;
    As two spent swimmers, that do cling together
    And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald--
    Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
    The multiplying villanies of nature
    Do swarm upon him--from the western isles
    Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
    And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
    Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
    For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name--
    Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
    Which smoked with bloody execution,
    Like valour's minion carved out his passage
    Till he faced the slave;
    Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
    Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,
    And fix'd his head upon our battlements.

DUNCAN

    O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!

Sergeant

    As whence the sun 'gins his reflection
    Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,
    So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come
    Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:
    No sooner justice had with valour arm'd
    Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
    But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,
    With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men
    Began a fresh assault.

DUNCAN

    Dismay'd not this
    Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?

Sergeant

    Yes;
    As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
    If I say sooth, I must report they were
    As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they
    Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:
    Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,
    Or memorise another Golgotha,
    I cannot tell.
    But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.

DUNCAN

    So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;
    They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.

    Exit Sergeant, attended
    Who comes here?

    Enter ROSS

MALCOLM

    The worthy thane of Ross.

LENNOX

    What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look
    That seems to speak things strange.

ROSS

    God save the king!

DUNCAN

    Whence camest thou, worthy thane?

ROSS

    From Fife, great king;
    Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
    And fan our people cold. Norway himself,
    With terrible numbers,
    Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
    The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;
    Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,
    Confronted him with self-comparisons,
    Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.
    Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,
    The victory fell on us.

DUNCAN

    Great happiness!

ROSS

    That now
    Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition:
    Nor would we deign him burial of his men
    Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch
    Ten thousand dollars to our general use.

DUNCAN

    No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive
    Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,
    And with his former title greet Macbeth.

ROSS

    I'll see it done.

DUNCAN

    What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. A heath near Forres.

    Thunder. Enter the three Witches 

First Witch

    Where hast thou been, sister?

Second Witch

    Killing swine.

Third Witch

    Sister, where thou?

First Witch

    A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,
    And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:--
    'Give me,' quoth I:
    'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.
    Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger:
    But in a sieve I'll thither sail,
    And, like a rat without a tail,
    I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.

Second Witch

    I'll give thee a wind.

First Witch

    Thou'rt kind.

Third Witch

    And I another.

First Witch

    I myself have all the other,
    And the very ports they blow,
    All the quarters that they know
    I' the shipman's card.
    I will drain him dry as hay:
    Sleep shall neither night nor day
    Hang upon his pent-house lid;
    He shall live a man forbid:
    Weary se'nnights nine times nine
    Shall he dwindle, peak and pine:
    Though his bark cannot be lost,
    Yet it shall be tempest-tost.
    Look what I have.

Second Witch

    Show me, show me.

First Witch

    Here I have a pilot's thumb,
    Wreck'd as homeward he did come.

    Drum within

Third Witch

    A drum, a drum!
    Macbeth doth come.

ALL

    The weird sisters, hand in hand,
    Posters of the sea and land,
    Thus do go about, about:
    Thrice to thine and thrice to mine
    And thrice again, to make up nine.
    Peace! the charm's wound up.

    Enter MACBETH and BANQUO

MACBETH

    So foul and fair a day I have not seen.

BANQUO

    How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these
    So wither'd and so wild in their attire,
    That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,
    And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught
    That man may question? You seem to understand me,
    By each at once her chappy finger laying
    Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,
    And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
    That you are so.

MACBETH

    Speak, if you can: what are you?

First Witch

    All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis!

Second Witch

    All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, thane of Cawdor!

Third Witch

    All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!

BANQUO

    Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear
    Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,
    Are ye fantastical, or that indeed
    Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner
    You greet with present grace and great prediction
    Of noble having and of royal hope,
    That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.
    If you can look into the seeds of time,
    And say which grain will grow and which will not,
    Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear
    Your favours nor your hate.

First Witch

    Hail!

Second Witch

    Hail!

Third Witch

    Hail!

First Witch

    Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.

Second Witch

    Not so happy, yet much happier.

Third Witch

    Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:
    So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!

First Witch

    Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!

MACBETH

    Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:
    By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;
    But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,
    A prosperous gentleman; and to be king
    Stands not within the prospect of belief,
    No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
    You owe this strange intelligence? or why
    Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
    With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.

    Witches vanish

BANQUO

    The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,
    And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?

MACBETH

    Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted
    As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!

BANQUO

    Were such things here as we do speak about?
    Or have we eaten on the insane root
    That takes the reason prisoner?

MACBETH

    Your children shall be kings.

BANQUO

    You shall be king.

MACBETH

    And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?

BANQUO

    To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?

    Enter ROSS and ANGUS

ROSS

    The king hath happily received, Macbeth,
    The news of thy success; and when he reads
    Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,
    His wonders and his praises do contend
    Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,
    In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,
    He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
    Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
    Strange images of death. As thick as hail
    Came post with post; and every one did bear
    Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,
    And pour'd them down before him.

ANGUS

    We are sent
    To give thee from our royal master thanks;
    Only to herald thee into his sight,
    Not pay thee.

ROSS

    And, for an earnest of a greater honour,
    He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor:
    In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!
    For it is thine.

BANQUO

    What, can the devil speak true?

MACBETH

    The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me
    In borrow'd robes?

ANGUS

    Who was the thane lives yet;
    But under heavy judgment bears that life
    Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined
    With those of Norway, or did line the rebel
    With hidden help and vantage, or that with both
    He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;
    But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,
    Have overthrown him.

MACBETH

    [Aside] Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!
    The greatest is behind.

    To ROSS and ANGUS
    Thanks for your pains.

    To BANQUO
    Do you not hope your children shall be kings,
    When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me
    Promised no less to them?

BANQUO

    That trusted home
    Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
    Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:
    And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,
    The instruments of darkness tell us truths,
    Win us with honest trifles, to betray's
    In deepest consequence.
    Cousins, a word, I pray you.

MACBETH

    [Aside] Two truths are told,
    As happy prologues to the swelling act
    Of the imperial theme.--I thank you, gentlemen.

    Aside
    Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,
    Why hath it given me earnest of success,
    Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:
    If good, why do I yield to that suggestion
    Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
    And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
    Against the use of nature? Present fears
    Are less than horrible imaginings:
    My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,
    Shakes so my single state of man that function
    Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is
    But what is not.

BANQUO

    Look, how our partner's rapt.

MACBETH

    [Aside] If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me,
    Without my stir.

BANQUO

    New horrors come upon him,
    Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould
    But with the aid of use.

MACBETH

    [Aside] Come what come may,
    Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.

BANQUO

    Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.

MACBETH

    Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought
    With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains
    Are register'd where every day I turn
    The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.
    Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,
    The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak
    Our free hearts each to other.

BANQUO

    Very gladly.

MACBETH

    Till then, enough. Come, friends.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. Forres. The palace.

    Flourish. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, LENNOX, and Attendants 

DUNCAN

    Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not
    Those in commission yet return'd?

MALCOLM

    My liege,
    They are not yet come back. But I have spoke
    With one that saw him die: who did report
    That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,
    Implored your highness' pardon and set forth
    A deep repentance: nothing in his life
    Became him like the leaving it; he died
    As one that had been studied in his death
    To throw away the dearest thing he owed,
    As 'twere a careless trifle.

DUNCAN

    There's no art
    To find the mind's construction in the face:
    He was a gentleman on whom I built
    An absolute trust.

    Enter MACBETH, BANQUO, ROSS, and ANGUS
    O worthiest cousin!
    The sin of my ingratitude even now
    Was heavy on me: thou art so far before
    That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
    To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,
    That the proportion both of thanks and payment
    Might have been mine! only I have left to say,
    More is thy due than more than all can pay.

MACBETH

    The service and the loyalty I owe,
    In doing it, pays itself. Your highness' part
    Is to receive our duties; and our duties
    Are to your throne and state children and servants,
    Which do but what they should, by doing every thing
    Safe toward your love and honour.

DUNCAN

    Welcome hither:
    I have begun to plant thee, and will labour
    To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,
    That hast no less deserved, nor must be known
    No less to have done so, let me enfold thee
    And hold thee to my heart.

BANQUO

    There if I grow,
    The harvest is your own.

DUNCAN

    My plenteous joys,
    Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves
    In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,
    And you whose places are the nearest, know
    We will establish our estate upon
    Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter
    The Prince of Cumberland; which honour must
    Not unaccompanied invest him only,
    But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine
    On all deservers. From hence to Inverness,
    And bind us further to you.

MACBETH

    The rest is labour, which is not used for you:
    I'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful
    The hearing of my wife with your approach;
    So humbly take my leave.

DUNCAN

    My worthy Cawdor!

MACBETH

    [Aside] The Prince of Cumberland! that is a step
    On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,
    For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires;
    Let not light see my black and deep desires:
    The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be,
    Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.

    Exit

DUNCAN

    True, worthy Banquo; he is full so valiant,
    And in his commendations I am fed;
    It is a banquet to me. Let's after him,
    Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome:
    It is a peerless kinsman.

    Flourish. Exeunt

SCENE V. Inverness. Macbeth's castle.

    Enter LADY MACBETH, reading a letter 

LADY MACBETH

    'They met me in the day of success: and I have
    learned by the perfectest report, they have more in
    them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire
    to question them further, they made themselves air,
    into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in
    the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who
    all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title,
    before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred
    me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king that
    shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver
    thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou
    mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being
    ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it
    to thy heart, and farewell.'
    Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be
    What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature;
    It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
    To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;
    Art not without ambition, but without
    The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,
    That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,
    And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great Glamis,
    That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;
    And that which rather thou dost fear to do
    Than wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither,
    That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;
    And chastise with the valour of my tongue
    All that impedes thee from the golden round,
    Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
    To have thee crown'd withal.

    Enter a Messenger
    What is your tidings?

Messenger

    The king comes here to-night.

LADY MACBETH

    Thou'rt mad to say it:
    Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,
    Would have inform'd for preparation.

Messenger

    So please you, it is true: our thane is coming:
    One of my fellows had the speed of him,
    Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more
    Than would make up his message.

LADY MACBETH

    Give him tending;
    He brings great news.

    Exit Messenger
    The raven himself is hoarse
    That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
    Under my battlements. Come, you spirits
    That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,
    And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
    Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;
    Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
    That no compunctious visitings of nature
    Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between
    The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,
    And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,
    Wherever in your sightless substances
    You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,
    And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,
    That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,
    Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,
    To cry 'Hold, hold!'

    Enter MACBETH
    Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor!
    Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!
    Thy letters have transported me beyond
    This ignorant present, and I feel now
    The future in the instant.

MACBETH

    My dearest love,
    Duncan comes here to-night.

LADY MACBETH

    And when goes hence?

MACBETH

    To-morrow, as he purposes.

LADY MACBETH

    O, never
    Shall sun that morrow see!
    Your face, my thane, is as a book where men
    May read strange matters. To beguile the time,
    Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,
    Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,
    But be the serpent under't. He that's coming
    Must be provided for: and you shall put
    This night's great business into my dispatch;
    Which shall to all our nights and days to come
    Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.

MACBETH

    We will speak further.

LADY MACBETH

    Only look up clear;
    To alter favour ever is to fear:
    Leave all the rest to me.

    Exeunt

SCENE VI. Before Macbeth's castle.

    Hautboys and torches. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, BANQUO, LENNOX, MACDUFF, ROSS, ANGUS, and Attendants 

DUNCAN

    This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air
    Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
    Unto our gentle senses.

BANQUO

    This guest of summer,
    The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
    By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath
    Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,
    Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird
    Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle:
    Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed,
    The air is delicate.

    Enter LADY MACBETH

DUNCAN

    See, see, our honour'd hostess!
    The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,
    Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you
    How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains,
    And thank us for your trouble.

LADY MACBETH

    All our service
    In every point twice done and then done double
    Were poor and single business to contend
    Against those honours deep and broad wherewith
    Your majesty loads our house: for those of old,
    And the late dignities heap'd up to them,
    We rest your hermits.

DUNCAN

    Where's the thane of Cawdor?
    We coursed him at the heels, and had a purpose
    To be his purveyor: but he rides well;
    And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him
    To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,
    We are your guest to-night.

LADY MACBETH

    Your servants ever
    Have theirs, themselves and what is theirs, in compt,
    To make their audit at your highness' pleasure,
    Still to return your own.

DUNCAN

    Give me your hand;
    Conduct me to mine host: we love him highly,
    And shall continue our graces towards him.
    By your leave, hostess.

    Exeunt

SCENE VII. Macbeth's castle.

    Hautboys and torches. Enter a Sewer, and divers Servants with dishes and service, and pass over the stage. Then enter MACBETH 

MACBETH

    If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well
    It were done quickly: if the assassination
    Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
    With his surcease success; that but this blow
    Might be the be-all and the end-all here,
    But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
    We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases
    We still have judgment here; that we but teach
    Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return
    To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice
    Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice
    To our own lips. He's here in double trust;
    First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
    Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
    Who should against his murderer shut the door,
    Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan
    Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
    So clear in his great office, that his virtues
    Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against
    The deep damnation of his taking-off;
    And pity, like a naked new-born babe,
    Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed
    Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
    Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
    That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
    To prick the sides of my intent, but only
    Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself
    And falls on the other.

    Enter LADY MACBETH
    How now! what news?

LADY MACBETH

    He has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber?

MACBETH

    Hath he ask'd for me?

LADY MACBETH

    Know you not he has?

MACBETH

    We will proceed no further in this business:
    He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought
    Golden opinions from all sorts of people,
    Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,
    Not cast aside so soon.

LADY MACBETH

    Was the hope drunk
    Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?
    And wakes it now, to look so green and pale
    At what it did so freely? From this time
    Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard
    To be the same in thine own act and valour
    As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that
    Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,
    And live a coward in thine own esteem,
    Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'
    Like the poor cat i' the adage?

MACBETH

    Prithee, peace:
    I dare do all that may become a man;
    Who dares do more is none.

LADY MACBETH

    What beast was't, then,
    That made you break this enterprise to me?
    When you durst do it, then you were a man;
    And, to be more than what you were, you would
    Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place
    Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:
    They have made themselves, and that their fitness now
    Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know
    How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:
    I would, while it was smiling in my face,
    Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,
    And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you
    Have done to this.

MACBETH

    If we should fail?

LADY MACBETH

    We fail!
    But screw your courage to the sticking-place,
    And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep--
    Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey
    Soundly invite him--his two chamberlains
    Will I with wine and wassail so convince
    That memory, the warder of the brain,
    Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason
    A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep
    Their drenched natures lie as in a death,
    What cannot you and I perform upon
    The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon
    His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt
    Of our great quell?

MACBETH

    Bring forth men-children only;
    For thy undaunted mettle should compose
    Nothing but males. Will it not be received,
    When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two
    Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,
    That they have done't?

LADY MACBETH

    Who dares receive it other,
    As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar
    Upon his death?

MACBETH

    I am settled, and bend up
    Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.
    Away, and mock the time with fairest show:
    False face must hide what the false heart doth know.

    Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. Court of Macbeth's castle.

    Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE bearing a torch before him 

BANQUO

    How goes the night, boy?

FLEANCE

    The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.

BANQUO

    And she goes down at twelve.

FLEANCE

    I take't, 'tis later, sir.

BANQUO

    Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven;
    Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.
    A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
    And yet I would not sleep: merciful powers,
    Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
    Gives way to in repose!

    Enter MACBETH, and a Servant with a torch
    Give me my sword.
    Who's there?

MACBETH

    A friend.

BANQUO

    What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed:
    He hath been in unusual pleasure, and
    Sent forth great largess to your offices.
    This diamond he greets your wife withal,
    By the name of most kind hostess; and shut up
    In measureless content.

MACBETH

    Being unprepared,
    Our will became the servant to defect;
    Which else should free have wrought.

BANQUO

    All's well.
    I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:
    To you they have show'd some truth.

MACBETH

    I think not of them:
    Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,
    We would spend it in some words upon that business,
    If you would grant the time.

BANQUO

    At your kind'st leisure.

MACBETH

    If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,
    It shall make honour for you.

BANQUO

    So I lose none
    In seeking to augment it, but still keep
    My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,
    I shall be counsell'd.

MACBETH

    Good repose the while!

BANQUO

    Thanks, sir: the like to you!

    Exeunt BANQUO and FLEANCE

MACBETH

    Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,
    She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.

    Exit Servant
    Is this a dagger which I see before me,
    The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.
    I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
    Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
    To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
    A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
    Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
    I see thee yet, in form as palpable
    As this which now I draw.
    Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;
    And such an instrument I was to use.
    Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,
    Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,
    And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,
    Which was not so before. There's no such thing:
    It is the bloody business which informs
    Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld
    Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
    The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates
    Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,
    Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,
    Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.
    With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design
    Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,
    Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear
    Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,
    And take the present horror from the time,
    Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:
    Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.

    A bell rings
    I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.
    Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell
    That summons thee to heaven or to hell.

    Exit

SCENE II. The same.

    Enter LADY MACBETH 

LADY MACBETH

    That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;
    What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.
    Hark! Peace!
    It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,
    Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it:
    The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms
    Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd
    their possets,
    That death and nature do contend about them,
    Whether they live or die.

MACBETH

    [Within] Who's there? what, ho!

LADY MACBETH

    Alack, I am afraid they have awaked,
    And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed
    Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready;
    He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled
    My father as he slept, I had done't.

    Enter MACBETH
    My husband!

MACBETH

    I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?

LADY MACBETH

    I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
    Did not you speak?

MACBETH

    When?

LADY MACBETH

    Now.

MACBETH

    As I descended?

LADY MACBETH

    Ay.

MACBETH

    Hark!
    Who lies i' the second chamber?

LADY MACBETH

    Donalbain.

MACBETH

    This is a sorry sight.

    Looking on his hands

LADY MACBETH

    A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.

MACBETH

    There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried
    'Murder!'
    That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them:
    But they did say their prayers, and address'd them
    Again to sleep.

LADY MACBETH

    There are two lodged together.

MACBETH

    One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other;
    As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.
    Listening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,'
    When they did say 'God bless us!'

LADY MACBETH

    Consider it not so deeply.

MACBETH

    But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?
    I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen'
    Stuck in my throat.

LADY MACBETH

    These deeds must not be thought
    After these ways; so, it will make us mad.

MACBETH

    Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!
    Macbeth does murder sleep', the innocent sleep,
    Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care,
    The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,
    Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,
    Chief nourisher in life's feast,--

LADY MACBETH

    What do you mean?

MACBETH

    Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house:
    'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor
    Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.'

LADY MACBETH

    Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,
    You do unbend your noble strength, to think
    So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,
    And wash this filthy witness from your hand.
    Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
    They must lie there: go carry them; and smear
    The sleepy grooms with blood.

MACBETH

    I'll go no more:
    I am afraid to think what I have done;
    Look on't again I dare not.

LADY MACBETH

    Infirm of purpose!
    Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead
    Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood
    That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,
    I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal;
    For it must seem their guilt.

    Exit. Knocking within

MACBETH

    Whence is that knocking?
    How is't with me, when every noise appals me?
    What hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine eyes.
    Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood
    Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather
    The multitudinous seas in incarnadine,
    Making the green one red.

    Re-enter LADY MACBETH

LADY MACBETH

    My hands are of your colour; but I shame
    To wear a heart so white.

    Knocking within
    I hear a knocking
    At the south entry: retire we to our chamber;
    A little water clears us of this deed:
    How easy is it, then! Your constancy
    Hath left you unattended.

    Knocking within
    Hark! more knocking.
    Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us,
    And show us to be watchers. Be not lost
    So poorly in your thoughts.

MACBETH

    To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.

    Knocking within
    Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!

    Exeunt

SCENE III. The same.

    Knocking within. Enter a Porter 

Porter

    Here's a knocking indeed! If a
    man were porter of hell-gate, he should have
    old turning the key.

    Knocking within
    Knock,
    knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of
    Beelzebub? Here's a farmer, that hanged
    himself on the expectation of plenty: come in
    time; have napkins enow about you; here
    you'll sweat for't.

    Knocking within
    Knock,
    knock! Who's there, in the other devil's
    name? Faith, here's an equivocator, that could
    swear in both the scales against either scale;
    who committed treason enough for God's sake,
    yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come
    in, equivocator.

    Knocking within
    Knock,
    knock, knock! Who's there? Faith, here's an
    English tailor come hither, for stealing out of
    a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may
    roast your goose.

    Knocking within
    Knock,
    knock; never at quiet! What are you? But
    this place is too cold for hell. I'll devil-porter
    it no further: I had thought to have let in
    some of all professions that go the primrose
    way to the everlasting bonfire.

    Knocking within
    Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter.

    Opens the gate

    Enter MACDUFF and LENNOX

MACDUFF

    Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,
    That you do lie so late?

Porter

    'Faith sir, we were carousing till the
    second cock: and drink, sir, is a great
    provoker of three things.

MACDUFF

    What three things does drink especially provoke?

Porter

    Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and
    urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes;
    it provokes the desire, but it takes
    away the performance: therefore, much drink
    may be said to be an equivocator with lechery:
    it makes him, and it mars him; it sets
    him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him,
    and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and
    not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him
    in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.

MACDUFF

    I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.

Porter

    That it did, sir, i' the very throat on
    me: but I requited him for his lie; and, I
    think, being too strong for him, though he took
    up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast
    him.

MACDUFF

    Is thy master stirring?

    Enter MACBETH
    Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes.

LENNOX

    Good morrow, noble sir.

MACBETH

    Good morrow, both.

MACDUFF

    Is the king stirring, worthy thane?

MACBETH

    Not yet.

MACDUFF

    He did command me to call timely on him:
    I have almost slipp'd the hour.

MACBETH

    I'll bring you to him.

MACDUFF

    I know this is a joyful trouble to you;
    But yet 'tis one.

MACBETH

    The labour we delight in physics pain.
    This is the door.

MACDUFF

    I'll make so bold to call,
    For 'tis my limited service.

    Exit

LENNOX

    Goes the king hence to-day?

MACBETH

    He does: he did appoint so.

LENNOX

    The night has been unruly: where we lay,
    Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say,
    Lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death,
    And prophesying with accents terrible
    Of dire combustion and confused events
    New hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure bird
    Clamour'd the livelong night: some say, the earth
    Was feverous and did shake.

MACBETH

    'Twas a rough night.

LENNOX

    My young remembrance cannot parallel
    A fellow to it.

    Re-enter MACDUFF

MACDUFF

    O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart
    Cannot conceive nor name thee!

MACBETH LENNOX

    What's the matter.

MACDUFF

    Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!
    Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope
    The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence
    The life o' the building!

MACBETH

    What is 't you say? the life?

LENNOX

    Mean you his majesty?

MACDUFF

    Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight
    With a new Gorgon: do not bid me speak;
    See, and then speak yourselves.

    Exeunt MACBETH and LENNOX
    Awake, awake!
    Ring the alarum-bell. Murder and treason!
    Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake!
    Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit,
    And look on death itself! up, up, and see
    The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo!
    As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites,
    To countenance this horror! Ring the bell.

    Bell rings

    Enter LADY MACBETH

LADY MACBETH

    What's the business,
    That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley
    The sleepers of the house? speak, speak!

MACDUFF

    O gentle lady,
    'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:
    The repetition, in a woman's ear,
    Would murder as it fell.

    Enter BANQUO
    O Banquo, Banquo,
    Our royal master 's murder'd!

LADY MACBETH

    Woe, alas!
    What, in our house?

BANQUO

    Too cruel any where.
    Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself,
    And say it is not so.

    Re-enter MACBETH and LENNOX, with ROSS

MACBETH

    Had I but died an hour before this chance,
    I had lived a blessed time; for, from this instant,
    There 's nothing serious in mortality:
    All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;
    The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees
    Is left this vault to brag of.

    Enter MALCOLM and DONALBAIN

DONALBAIN

    What is amiss?

MACBETH

    You are, and do not know't:
    The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood
    Is stopp'd; the very source of it is stopp'd.

MACDUFF

    Your royal father 's murder'd.

MALCOLM

    O, by whom?

LENNOX

    Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done 't:
    Their hands and faces were an badged with blood;
    So were their daggers, which unwiped we found
    Upon their pillows:
    They stared, and were distracted; no man's life
    Was to be trusted with them.

MACBETH

    O, yet I do repent me of my fury,
    That I did kill them.

MACDUFF

    Wherefore did you so?

MACBETH

    Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,
    Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man:
    The expedition my violent love
    Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,
    His silver skin laced with his golden blood;
    And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature
    For ruin's wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,
    Steep'd in the colours of their trade, their daggers
    Unmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refrain,
    That had a heart to love, and in that heart
    Courage to make 's love kno wn?

LADY MACBETH

    Help me hence, ho!

MACDUFF

    Look to the lady.

MALCOLM

    [Aside to DONALBAIN] Why do we hold our tongues,
    That most may claim this argument for ours?

DONALBAIN

    [Aside to MALCOLM] What should be spoken here,
    where our fate,
    Hid in an auger-hole, may rush, and seize us?
    Let 's away;
    Our tears are not yet brew'd.

MALCOLM

    [Aside to DONALBAIN] Nor our strong sorrow
    Upon the foot of motion.

BANQUO

    Look to the lady:

    LADY MACBETH is carried out
    And when we have our naked frailties hid,
    That suffer in exposure, let us meet,
    And question this most bloody piece of work,
    To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:
    In the great hand of God I stand; and thence
    Against the undivulged pretence I fight
    Of treasonous malice.

MACDUFF

    And so do I.

ALL

    So all.

MACBETH

    Let's briefly put on manly readiness,
    And meet i' the hall together.

ALL

    Well contented.

    Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain.

MALCOLM

    What will you do? Let's not consort with them:
    To show an unfelt sorrow is an office
    Which the false man does easy. I'll to England.

DONALBAIN

    To Ireland, I; our separated fortune
    Shall keep us both the safer: where we are,
    There's daggers in men's smiles: the near in blood,
    The nearer bloody.

MALCOLM

    This murderous shaft that's shot
    Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way
    Is to avoid the aim. Therefore, to horse;
    And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,
    But shift away: there's warrant in that theft
    Which steals itself, when there's no mercy left.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. Outside Macbeth's castle.

    Enter ROSS and an old Man 

Old Man

    Threescore and ten I can remember well:
    Within the volume of which time I have seen
    Hours dreadful and things strange; but this sore night
    Hath trifled former knowings.

ROSS

    Ah, good father,
    Thou seest, the heavens, as troubled with man's act,
    Threaten his bloody stage: by the clock, 'tis day,
    And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp:
    Is't night's predominance, or the day's shame,
    That darkness does the face of earth entomb,
    When living light should kiss it?

Old Man

    'Tis unnatural,
    Even like the deed that's done. On Tuesday last,
    A falcon, towering in her pride of place,
    Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.

ROSS

    And Duncan's horses--a thing most strange and certain--
    Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,
    Turn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,
    Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would make
    War with mankind.

Old Man

    'Tis said they eat each other.

ROSS

    They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes
    That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.

    Enter MACDUFF
    How goes the world, sir, now?

MACDUFF

    Why, see you not?

ROSS

    Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?

MACDUFF

    Those that Macbeth hath slain.

ROSS

    Alas, the day!
    What good could they pretend?

MACDUFF

    They were suborn'd:
    Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons,
    Are stol'n away and fled; which puts upon them
    Suspicion of the deed.

ROSS

    'Gainst nature still!
    Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up
    Thine own life's means! Then 'tis most like
    The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.

MACDUFF

    He is already named, and gone to Scone
    To be invested.

ROSS

    Where is Duncan's body?

MACDUFF

    Carried to Colmekill,
    The sacred storehouse of his predecessors,
    And guardian of their bones.

ROSS

    Will you to Scone?

MACDUFF

    No, cousin, I'll to Fife.

ROSS

    Well, I will thither.

MACDUFF

    Well, may you see things well done there: adieu!
    Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!

ROSS

    Farewell, father.

Old Man

    God's benison go with you; and with those
    That would make good of bad, and friends of foes!

    Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. Forres. The palace.

    Enter BANQUO 

BANQUO

    Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all,
    As the weird women promised, and, I fear,
    Thou play'dst most foully for't: yet it was said
    It should not stand in thy posterity,
    But that myself should be the root and father
    Of many kings. If there come truth from them--
    As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine--
    Why, by the verities on thee made good,
    May they not be my oracles as well,
    And set me up in hope? But hush! no more.

    Sennet sounded. Enter MACBETH, as king, LADY MACBETH, as queen, LENNOX, ROSS, Lords, Ladies, and Attendants

MACBETH

    Here's our chief guest.

LADY MACBETH

    If he had been forgotten,
    It had been as a gap in our great feast,
    And all-thing unbecoming.

MACBETH

    To-night we hold a solemn supper sir,
    And I'll request your presence.

BANQUO

    Let your highness
    Command upon me; to the which my duties
    Are with a most indissoluble tie
    For ever knit.

MACBETH

    Ride you this afternoon?

BANQUO

    Ay, my good lord.

MACBETH

    We should have else desired your good advice,
    Which still hath been both grave and prosperous,
    In this day's council; but we'll take to-morrow.
    Is't far you ride?

BANQUO

    As far, my lord, as will fill up the time
    'Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,
    I must become a borrower of the night
    For a dark hour or twain.

MACBETH

    Fail not our feast.

BANQUO

    My lord, I will not.

MACBETH

    We hear, our bloody cousins are bestow'd
    In England and in Ireland, not confessing
    Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers
    With strange invention: but of that to-morrow,
    When therewithal we shall have cause of state
    Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu,
    Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?

BANQUO

    Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon 's.

MACBETH

    I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;
    And so I do commend you to their backs. Farewell.

    Exit BANQUO
    Let every man be master of his time
    Till seven at night: to make society
    The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself
    Till supper-time alone: while then, God be with you!

    Exeunt all but MACBETH, and an attendant
    Sirrah, a word with you: attend those men
    Our pleasure?

ATTENDANT

    They are, my lord, without the palace gate.

MACBETH

    Bring them before us.

    Exit Attendant
    To be thus is nothing;
    But to be safely thus.--Our fears in Banquo
    Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature
    Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
    And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
    He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour
    To act in safety. There is none but he
    Whose being I do fear: and, under him,
    My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,
    Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
    When first they put the name of king upon me,
    And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like
    They hail'd him father to a line of kings:
    Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,
    And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
    Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,
    No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,
    For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;
    For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;
    Put rancours in the vessel of my peace
    Only for them; and mine eternal jewel
    Given to the common enemy of man,
    To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!
    Rather than so, come fate into the list.
    And champion me to the utterance! Who's there!

    Re-enter Attendant, with two Murderers
    Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.

    Exit Attendant
    Was it not yesterday we spoke together?

First Murderer

    It was, so please your highness.

MACBETH

    Well then, now
    Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know
    That it was he in the times past which held you
    So under fortune, which you thought had been
    Our innocent self: this I made good to you
    In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,
    How you were borne in hand, how cross'd,
    the instruments,
    Who wrought with them, and all things else that might
    To half a soul and to a notion crazed
    Say 'Thus did Banquo.'

First Murderer

    You made it known to us.

MACBETH

    I did so, and went further, which is now
    Our point of second meeting. Do you find
    Your patience so predominant in your nature
    That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd
    To pray for this good man and for his issue,
    Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave
    And beggar'd yours for ever?

First Murderer

    We are men, my liege.

MACBETH

    Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;
    As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,
    Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept
    All by the name of dogs: the valued file
    Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,
    The housekeeper, the hunter, every one
    According to the gift which bounteous nature
    Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive
    Particular addition. from the bill
    That writes them all alike: and so of men.
    Now, if you have a station in the file,
    Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say 't;
    And I will put that business in your bosoms,
    Whose execution takes your enemy off,
    Grapples you to the heart and love of us,
    Who wear our health but sickly in his life,
    Which in his death were perfect.

Second Murderer

    I am one, my liege,
    Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
    Have so incensed that I am reckless what
    I do to spite the world.

First Murderer

    And I another
    So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,
    That I would set my lie on any chance,
    To mend it, or be rid on't.

MACBETH

    Both of you
    Know Banquo was your enemy.

Both Murderers

    True, my lord.

MACBETH

    So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,
    That every minute of his being thrusts
    Against my near'st of life: and though I could
    With barefaced power sweep him from my sight
    And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,
    For certain friends that are both his and mine,
    Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall
    Who I myself struck down; and thence it is,
    That I to your assistance do make love,
    Masking the business from the common eye
    For sundry weighty reasons.

Second Murderer

    We shall, my lord,
    Perform what you command us.

First Murderer

    Though our lives--

MACBETH

    Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most
    I will advise you where to plant yourselves;
    Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,
    The moment on't; for't must be done to-night,
    And something from the palace; always thought
    That I require a clearness: and with him--
    To leave no rubs nor botches in the work--
    Fleance his son, that keeps him company,
    Whose absence is no less material to me
    Than is his father's, must embrace the fate
    Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart:
    I'll come to you anon.

Both Murderers

    We are resolved, my lord.

MACBETH

    I'll call upon you straight: abide within.

    Exeunt Murderers
    It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight,
    If it find heaven, must find it out to-night.

    Exit

SCENE II. The palace.

    Enter LADY MACBETH and a Servant 

LADY MACBETH

    Is Banquo gone from court?

Servant

    Ay, madam, but returns again to-night.

LADY MACBETH

    Say to the king, I would attend his leisure
    For a few words.

Servant

    Madam, I will.

    Exit

LADY MACBETH

    Nought's had, all's spent,
    Where our desire is got without content:
    'Tis safer to be that which we destroy
    Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.

    Enter MACBETH
    How now, my lord! why do you keep alone,
    Of sorriest fancies your companions making,
    Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
    With them they think on? Things without all remedy
    Should be without regard: what's done is done.

MACBETH

    We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:
    She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice
    Remains in danger of her former tooth.
    But let the frame of things disjoint, both the
    worlds suffer,
    Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
    In the affliction of these terrible dreams
    That shake us nightly: better be with the dead,
    Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,
    Than on the torture of the mind to lie
    In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;
    After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;
    Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,
    Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
    Can touch him further.

LADY MACBETH

    Come on;
    Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;
    Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.

MACBETH

    So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you:
    Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;
    Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:
    Unsafe the while, that we
    Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,
    And make our faces vizards to our hearts,
    Disguising what they are.

LADY MACBETH

    You must leave this.

MACBETH

    O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!
    Thou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.

LADY MACBETH

    But in them nature's copy's not eterne.

MACBETH

    There's comfort yet; they are assailable;
    Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown
    His cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's summons
    The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums
    Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done
    A deed of dreadful note.

LADY MACBETH

    What's to be done?

MACBETH

    Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,
    Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,
    Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;
    And with thy bloody and invisible hand
    Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
    Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow
    Makes wing to the rooky wood:
    Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;
    While night's black agents to their preys do rouse.
    Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still;
    Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.
    So, prithee, go with me.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. A park near the palace.

    Enter three Murderers 

First Murderer

    But who did bid thee join with us?

Third Murderer

    Macbeth.

Second Murderer

    He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers
    Our offices and what we have to do
    To the direction just.

First Murderer

    Then stand with us.
    The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day:
    Now spurs the lated traveller apace
    To gain the timely inn; and near approaches
    The subject of our watch.

Third Murderer

    Hark! I hear horses.

BANQUO

    [Within] Give us a light there, ho!

Second Murderer

    Then 'tis he: the rest
    That are within the note of expectation
    Already are i' the court.

First Murderer

    His horses go about.

Third Murderer

    Almost a mile: but he does usually,
    So all men do, from hence to the palace gate
    Make it their walk.

Second Murderer

    A light, a light!

    Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE with a torch

Third Murderer

    'Tis he.

First Murderer

    Stand to't.

BANQUO

    It will be rain to-night.

First Murderer

    Let it come down.

    They set upon BANQUO

BANQUO

    O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
    Thou mayst revenge. O slave!

    Dies. FLEANCE escapes

Third Murderer

    Who did strike out the light?

First Murderer

    Wast not the way?

Third Murderer

    There's but one down; the son is fled.

Second Murderer

    We have lost
    Best half of our affair.

First Murderer

    Well, let's away, and say how much is done.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. The same. Hall in the palace.

    A banquet prepared. Enter MACBETH, LADY MACBETH, ROSS, LENNOX, Lords, and Attendants 

MACBETH

    You know your own degrees; sit down: at first
    And last the hearty welcome.

Lords

    Thanks to your majesty.

MACBETH

    Ourself will mingle with society,
    And play the humble host.
    Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time
    We will require her welcome.

LADY MACBETH

    Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;
    For my heart speaks they are welcome.

    First Murderer appears at the door

MACBETH

    See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.
    Both sides are even: here I'll sit i' the midst:
    Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measure
    The table round.

    Approaching the door
    There's blood on thy face.

First Murderer

    'Tis Banquo's then.

MACBETH

    'Tis better thee without than he within.
    Is he dispatch'd?

First Murderer

    My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.

MACBETH

    Thou art the best o' the cut-throats: yet he's good
    That did the like for Fleance: if thou didst it,
    Thou art the nonpareil.

First Murderer

    Most royal sir,
    Fleance is 'scaped.

MACBETH

    Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect,
    Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,
    As broad and general as the casing air:
    But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in
    To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's safe?

First Murderer

    Ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides,
    With twenty trenched gashes on his head;
    The least a death to nature.

MACBETH

    Thanks for that:
    There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled
    Hath nature that in time will venom breed,
    No teeth for the present. Get thee gone: to-morrow
    We'll hear, ourselves, again.

    Exit Murderer

LADY MACBETH

    My royal lord,
    You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold
    That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a-making,
    'Tis given with welcome: to feed were best at home;
    From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;
    Meeting were bare without it.

MACBETH

    Sweet remembrancer!
    Now, good digestion wait on appetite,
    And health on both!

LENNOX

    May't please your highness sit.

    The GHOST OF BANQUO enters, and sits in MACBETH's place

MACBETH

    Here had we now our country's honour roof'd,
    Were the graced person of our Banquo present;
    Who may I rather challenge for unkindness
    Than pity for mischance!

ROSS

    His absence, sir,
    Lays blame upon his promise. Please't your highness
    To grace us with your royal company.

MACBETH

    The table's full.

LENNOX

    Here is a place reserved, sir.

MACBETH

    Where?

LENNOX

    Here, my good lord. What is't that moves your highness?

MACBETH

    Which of you have done this?

Lords

    What, my good lord?

MACBETH

    Thou canst not say I did it: never shake
    Thy gory locks at me.

ROSS

    Gentlemen, rise: his highness is not well.

LADY MACBETH

    Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,
    And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;
    The fit is momentary; upon a thought
    He will again be well: if much you note him,
    You shall offend him and extend his passion:
    Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man?

MACBETH

    Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that
    Which might appal the devil.

LADY MACBETH

    O proper stuff!
    This is the very painting of your fear:
    This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said,
    Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,
    Impostors to true fear, would well become
    A woman's story at a winter's fire,
    Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!
    Why do you make such faces? When all's done,
    You look but on a stool.

MACBETH

    Prithee, see there! behold! look! lo!
    how say you?
    Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.
    If charnel-houses and our graves must send
    Those that we bury back, our monuments
    Shall be the maws of kites.

    GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes

LADY MACBETH

    What, quite unmann'd in folly?

MACBETH

    If I stand here, I saw him.

LADY MACBETH

    Fie, for shame!

MACBETH

    Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,
    Ere human statute purged the gentle weal;
    Ay, and since too, murders have been perform'd
    Too terrible for the ear: the times have been,
    That, when the brains were out, the man would die,
    And there an end; but now they rise again,
    With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,
    And push us from our stools: this is more strange
    Than such a murder is.

LADY MACBETH

    My worthy lord,
    Your noble friends do lack you.

MACBETH

    I do forget.
    Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends,
    I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing
    To those that know me. Come, love and health to all;
    Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.
    I drink to the general joy o' the whole table,
    And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss;
    Would he were here! to all, and him, we thirst,
    And all to all.

Lords

    Our duties, and the pledge.

    Re-enter GHOST OF BANQUO

MACBETH

    Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!
    Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;
    Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
    Which thou dost glare with!

LADY MACBETH

    Think of this, good peers,
    But as a thing of custom: 'tis no other;
    Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.

MACBETH

    What man dare, I dare:
    Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,
    The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger;
    Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves
    Shall never tremble: or be alive again,
    And dare me to the desert with thy sword;
    If trembling I inhabit then, protest me
    The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!
    Unreal mockery, hence!

    GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes
    Why, so: being gone,
    I am a man again. Pray you, sit still.

LADY MACBETH

    You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting,
    With most admired disorder.

MACBETH

    Can such things be,
    And overcome us like a summer's cloud,
    Without our special wonder? You make me strange
    Even to the disposition that I owe,
    When now I think you can behold such sights,
    And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,
    When mine is blanched with fear.

ROSS

    What sights, my lord?

LADY MACBETH

    I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;
    Question enrages him. At once, good night:
    Stand not upon the order of your going,
    But go at once.

LENNOX

    Good night; and better health
    Attend his majesty!

LADY MACBETH

    A kind good night to all!

    Exeunt all but MACBETH and LADY MACBETH

MACBETH

    It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood:
    Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;
    Augurs and understood relations have
    By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth
    The secret'st man of blood. What is the night?

LADY MACBETH

    Almost at odds with morning, which is which.

MACBETH

    How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person
    At our great bidding?

LADY MACBETH

    Did you send to him, sir?

MACBETH

    I hear it by the way; but I will send:
    There's not a one of them but in his house
    I keep a servant fee'd. I will to-morrow,
    And betimes I will, to the weird sisters:
    More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,
    By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,
    All causes shall give way: I am in blood
    Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,
    Returning were as tedious as go o'er:
    Strange things I have in head, that will to hand;
    Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.

LADY MACBETH

    You lack the season of all natures, sleep.

MACBETH

    Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse
    Is the initiate fear that wants hard use:
    We are yet but young in deed.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. A Heath.

    Thunder. Enter the three Witches meeting HECATE 

First Witch

    Why, how now, Hecate! you look angerly.

HECATE

    Have I not reason, beldams as you are,
    Saucy and overbold? How did you dare
    To trade and traffic with Macbeth
    In riddles and affairs of death;
    And I, the mistress of your charms,
    The close contriver of all harms,
    Was never call'd to bear my part,
    Or show the glory of our art?
    And, which is worse, all you have done
    Hath been but for a wayward son,
    Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,
    Loves for his own ends, not for you.
    But make amends now: get you gone,
    And at the pit of Acheron
    Meet me i' the morning: thither he
    Will come to know his destiny:
    Your vessels and your spells provide,
    Your charms and every thing beside.
    I am for the air; this night I'll spend
    Unto a dismal and a fatal end:
    Great business must be wrought ere noon:
    Upon the corner of the moon
    There hangs a vaporous drop profound;
    I'll catch it ere it come to ground:
    And that distill'd by magic sleights
    Shall raise such artificial sprites
    As by the strength of their illusion
    Shall draw him on to his confusion:
    He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear
    He hopes 'bove wisdom, grace and fear:
    And you all know, security
    Is mortals' chiefest enemy.

    Music and a song within: 'Come away, come away,' & c
    Hark! I am call'd; my little spirit, see,
    Sits in a foggy cloud, and stays for me.

    Exit

First Witch

    Come, let's make haste; she'll soon be back again.

    Exeunt

SCENE VI. Forres. The palace.

    Enter LENNOX and another Lord 

LENNOX

    My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,
    Which can interpret further: only, I say,
    Things have been strangely borne. The
    gracious Duncan
    Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:
    And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;
    Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,
    For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.
    Who cannot want the thought how monstrous
    It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
    To kill their gracious father? damned fact!
    How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight
    In pious rage the two delinquents tear,
    That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?
    Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;
    For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive
    To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,
    He has borne all things well: and I do think
    That had he Duncan's sons under his key--
    As, an't please heaven, he shall not--they
    should find
    What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.
    But, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd
    His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear
    Macduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell
    Where he bestows himself?

Lord

    The son of Duncan,
    From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth
    Lives in the English court, and is received
    Of the most pious Edward with such grace
    That the malevolence of fortune nothing
    Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff
    Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid
    To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward:
    That, by the help of these--with Him above
    To ratify the work--we may again
    Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,
    Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,
    Do faithful homage and receive free honours:
    All which we pine for now: and this report
    Hath so exasperate the king that he
    Prepares for some attempt of war.

LENNOX

    Sent he to Macduff?

Lord

    He did: and with an absolute 'Sir, not I,'
    The cloudy messenger turns me his back,
    And hums, as who should say 'You'll rue the time
    That clogs me with this answer.'

LENNOX

    And that well might
    Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance
    His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel
    Fly to the court of England and unfold
    His message ere he come, that a swift blessing
    May soon return to this our suffering country
    Under a hand accursed!

Lord

    I'll send my prayers with him.

    Exeunt

ACT IV
SCENE I. A cavern. In the middle, a boiling cauldron.

    Thunder. Enter the three Witches 

First Witch

    Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd.

Second Witch

    Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined.

Third Witch

    Harpier cries 'Tis time, 'tis time.

First Witch

    Round about the cauldron go;
    In the poison'd entrails throw.
    Toad, that under cold stone
    Days and nights has thirty-one
    Swelter'd venom sleeping got,
    Boil thou first i' the charmed pot.

ALL

    Double, double toil and trouble;
    Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.

Second Witch

    Fillet of a fenny snake,
    In the cauldron boil and bake;
    Eye of newt and toe of frog,
    Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
    Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,
    Lizard's leg and owlet's wing,
    For a charm of powerful trouble,
    Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.

ALL

    Double, double toil and trouble;
    Fire burn and cauldron bubble.

Third Witch

    Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,
    Witches' mummy, maw and gulf
    Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark,
    Root of hemlock digg'd i' the dark,
    Liver of blaspheming Jew,
    Gall of goat, and slips of yew
    Silver'd in the moon's eclipse,
    Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips,
    Finger of birth-strangled babe
    Ditch-deliver'd by a drab,
    Make the gruel thick and slab:
    Add thereto a tiger's chaudron,
    For the ingredients of our cauldron.

ALL

    Double, double toil and trouble;
    Fire burn and cauldron bubble.

Second Witch

    Cool it with a baboon's blood,
    Then the charm is firm and good.

    Enter HECATE to the other three Witches

HECATE

    O well done! I commend your pains;
    And every one shall share i' the gains;
    And now about the cauldron sing,
    Live elves and fairies in a ring,
    Enchanting all that you put in.

    Music and a song: 'Black spirits,' & c

    HECATE retires

Second Witch

    By the pricking of my thumbs,
    Something wicked this way comes.
    Open, locks,
    Whoever knocks!

    Enter MACBETH

MACBETH

    How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!
    What is't you do?

ALL

    A deed without a name.

MACBETH

    I conjure you, by that which you profess,
    Howe'er you come to know it, answer me:
    Though you untie the winds and let them fight
    Against the churches; though the yesty waves
    Confound and swallow navigation up;
    Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down;
    Though castles topple on their warders' heads;
    Though palaces and pyramids do slope
    Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure
    Of nature's germens tumble all together,
    Even till destruction sicken; answer me
    To what I ask you.

First Witch

    Speak.

Second Witch

    Demand.

Third Witch

    We'll answer.

First Witch

    Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths,
    Or from our masters?

MACBETH

    Call 'em; let me see 'em.

First Witch

    Pour in sow's blood, that hath eaten
    Her nine farrow; grease that's sweaten
    From the murderer's gibbet throw
    Into the flame.

ALL

    Come, high or low;
    Thyself and office deftly show!

    Thunder. First Apparition: an armed Head

MACBETH

    Tell me, thou unknown power,--

First Witch

    He knows thy thought:
    Hear his speech, but say thou nought.

First Apparition

    Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! beware Macduff;
    Beware the thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough.

    Descends

MACBETH

    Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;
    Thou hast harp'd my fear aright: but one
    word more,--

First Witch

    He will not be commanded: here's another,
    More potent than the first.

    Thunder. Second Apparition: A bloody Child

Second Apparition

    Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!

MACBETH

    Had I three ears, I'ld hear thee.

Second Apparition

    Be bloody, bold, and resolute; laugh to scorn
    The power of man, for none of woman born
    Shall harm Macbeth.

    Descends

MACBETH

    Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee?
    But yet I'll make assurance double sure,
    And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live;
    That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,
    And sleep in spite of thunder.

    Thunder. Third Apparition: a Child crowned, with a tree in his hand
    What is this
    That rises like the issue of a king,
    And wears upon his baby-brow the round
    And top of sovereignty?

ALL

    Listen, but speak not to't.

Third Apparition

    Be lion-mettled, proud; and take no care
    Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are:
    Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until
    Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill
    Shall come against him.

    Descends

MACBETH

    That will never be
    Who can impress the forest, bid the tree
    Unfix his earth-bound root? Sweet bodements! good!
    Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
    Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth
    Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath
    To time and mortal custom. Yet my heart
    Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art
    Can tell so much: shall Banquo's issue ever
    Reign in this kingdom?

ALL

    Seek to know no more.

MACBETH

    I will be satisfied: deny me this,
    And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know.
    Why sinks that cauldron? and what noise is this?

    Hautboys

First Witch

    Show!

Second Witch

    Show!

Third Witch

    Show!

ALL

    Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;
    Come like shadows, so depart!

    A show of Eight Kings, the last with a glass in his hand; GHOST OF BANQUO following

MACBETH

    Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo: down!
    Thy crown does sear mine eye-balls. And thy hair,
    Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.
    A third is like the former. Filthy hags!
    Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes!
    What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?
    Another yet! A seventh! I'll see no more:
    And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass
    Which shows me many more; and some I see
    That two-fold balls and treble scepters carry:
    Horrible sight! Now, I see, 'tis true;
    For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me,
    And points at them for his.

    Apparitions vanish
    What, is this so?

First Witch

    Ay, sir, all this is so: but why
    Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?
    Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites,
    And show the best of our delights:
    I'll charm the air to give a sound,
    While you perform your antic round:
    That this great king may kindly say,
    Our duties did his welcome pay.

    Music. The witches dance and then vanish, with HECATE

MACBETH

    Where are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour
    Stand aye accursed in the calendar!
    Come in, without there!

    Enter LENNOX

LENNOX

    What's your grace's will?

MACBETH

    Saw you the weird sisters?

LENNOX

    No, my lord.

MACBETH

    Came they not by you?

LENNOX

    No, indeed, my lord.

MACBETH

    Infected be the air whereon they ride;
    And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear
    The galloping of horse: who was't came by?

LENNOX

    'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word
    Macduff is fled to England.

MACBETH

    Fled to England!

LENNOX

    Ay, my good lord.

MACBETH

    Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits:
    The flighty purpose never is o'ertook
    Unless the deed go with it; from this moment
    The very firstlings of my heart shall be
    The firstlings of my hand. And even now,
    To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:
    The castle of Macduff I will surprise;
    Seize upon Fife; give to the edge o' the sword
    His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls
    That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;
    This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.
    But no more sights!--Where are these gentlemen?
    Come, bring me where they are.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Fife. Macduff's castle.

    Enter LADY MACDUFF, her Son, and ROSS 

LADY MACDUFF

    What had he done, to make him fly the land?

ROSS

    You must have patience, madam.

LADY MACDUFF

    He had none:
    His flight was madness: when our actions do not,
    Our fears do make us traitors.

ROSS

    You know not
    Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.

LADY MACDUFF

    Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,
    His mansion and his titles in a place
    From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;
    He wants the natural touch: for the poor wren,
    The most diminutive of birds, will fight,
    Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
    All is the fear and nothing is the love;
    As little is the wisdom, where the flight
    So runs against all reason.

ROSS

    My dearest coz,
    I pray you, school yourself: but for your husband,
    He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows
    The fits o' the season. I dare not speak
    much further;
    But cruel are the times, when we are traitors
    And do not know ourselves, when we hold rumour
    From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,
    But float upon a wild and violent sea
    Each way and move. I take my leave of you:
    Shall not be long but I'll be here again:
    Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward
    To what they were before. My pretty cousin,
    Blessing upon you!

LADY MACDUFF

    Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.

ROSS

    I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,
    It would be my disgrace and your discomfort:
    I take my leave at once.

    Exit

LADY MACDUFF

    Sirrah, your father's dead;
    And what will you do now? How will you live?

Son

    As birds do, mother.

LADY MACDUFF

    What, with worms and flies?

Son

    With what I get, I mean; and so do they.

LADY MACDUFF

    Poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,
    The pitfall nor the gin.

Son

    Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for.
    My father is not dead, for all your saying.

LADY MACDUFF

    Yes, he is dead; how wilt thou do for a father?

Son

    Nay, how will you do for a husband?

LADY MACDUFF

    Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.

Son

    Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.

LADY MACDUFF

    Thou speak'st with all thy wit: and yet, i' faith,
    With wit enough for thee.

Son

    Was my father a traitor, mother?

LADY MACDUFF

    Ay, that he was.

Son

    What is a traitor?

LADY MACDUFF

    Why, one that swears and lies.

Son

    And be all traitors that do so?

LADY MACDUFF

    Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged.

Son

    And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?

LADY MACDUFF

    Every one.

Son

    Who must hang them?

LADY MACDUFF

    Why, the honest men.

Son

    Then the liars and swearers are fools,
    for there are liars and swearers enow to beat
    the honest men and hang up them.

LADY MACDUFF

    Now, God help thee, poor monkey!
    But how wilt thou do for a father?

Son

    If he were dead, you'ld weep for
    him: if you would not, it were a good sign
    that I should quickly have a new father.

LADY MACDUFF

    Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!

    Enter a Messenger

Messenger

    Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,
    Though in your state of honour I am perfect.
    I doubt some danger does approach you nearly:
    If you will take a homely man's advice,
    Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.
    To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage;
    To do worse to you were fell cruelty,
    Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!
    I dare abide no longer.

    Exit

LADY MACDUFF

    Whither should I fly?
    I have done no harm. But I remember now
    I am in this earthly world; where to do harm
    Is often laudable, to do good sometime
    Accounted dangerous folly: why then, alas,
    Do I put up that womanly defence,
    To say I have done no harm?

    Enter Murderers
    What are these faces?

First Murderer

    Where is your husband?

LADY MACDUFF

    I hope, in no place so unsanctified
    Where such as thou mayst find him.

First Murderer

    He's a traitor.

Son

    Thou liest, thou shag-hair'd villain!

First Murderer

    What, you egg!

    Stabbing him
    Young fry of treachery!

Son

    He has kill'd me, mother:
    Run away, I pray you!

    Dies

    Exit LADY MACDUFF, crying 'Murder!' Exeunt Murderers, following her

SCENE III. England. Before the King's palace.

    Enter MALCOLM and MACDUFF 

MALCOLM

    Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there
    Weep our sad bosoms empty.

MACDUFF

    Let us rather
    Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men
    Bestride our down-fall'n birthdom: each new morn
    New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows
    Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds
    As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out
    Like syllable of dolour.

MALCOLM

    What I believe I'll wail,
    What know believe, and what I can redress,
    As I shall find the time to friend, I will.
    What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.
    This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,
    Was once thought honest: you have loved him well.
    He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young;
    but something
    You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom
    To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb
    To appease an angry god.

MACDUFF

    I am not treacherous.

MALCOLM

    But Macbeth is.
    A good and virtuous nature may recoil
    In an imperial charge. But I shall crave
    your pardon;
    That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose:
    Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell;
    Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,
    Yet grace must still look so.

MACDUFF

    I have lost my hopes.

MALCOLM

    Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.
    Why in that rawness left you wife and child,
    Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,
    Without leave-taking? I pray you,
    Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,
    But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,
    Whatever I shall think.

MACDUFF

    Bleed, bleed, poor country!
    Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure,
    For goodness dare not cheque thee: wear thou
    thy wrongs;
    The title is affeer'd! Fare thee well, lord:
    I would not be the villain that thou think'st
    For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,
    And the rich East to boot.

MALCOLM

    Be not offended:
    I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
    I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;
    It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash
    Is added to her wounds: I think withal
    There would be hands uplifted in my right;
    And here from gracious England have I offer
    Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,
    When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,
    Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country
    Shall have more vices than it had before,
    More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,
    By him that shall succeed.

MACDUFF

    What should he be?

MALCOLM

    It is myself I mean: in whom I know
    All the particulars of vice so grafted
    That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth
    Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state
    Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
    With my confineless harms.

MACDUFF

    Not in the legions
    Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd
    In evils to top Macbeth.

MALCOLM

    I grant him bloody,
    Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,
    Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin
    That has a name: but there's no bottom, none,
    In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,
    Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up
    The cistern of my lust, and my desire
    All continent impediments would o'erbear
    That did oppose my will: better Macbeth
    Than such an one to reign.

MACDUFF

    Boundless intemperance
    In nature is a tyranny; it hath been
    The untimely emptying of the happy throne
    And fall of many kings. But fear not yet
    To take upon you what is yours: you may
    Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,
    And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.
    We have willing dames enough: there cannot be
    That vulture in you, to devour so many
    As will to greatness dedicate themselves,
    Finding it so inclined.

MALCOLM

    With this there grows
    In my most ill-composed affection such
    A stanchless avarice that, were I king,
    I should cut off the nobles for their lands,
    Desire his jewels and this other's house:
    And my more-having would be as a sauce
    To make me hunger more; that I should forge
    Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,
    Destroying them for wealth.

MACDUFF

    This avarice
    Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root
    Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been
    The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;
    Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will.
    Of your mere own: all these are portable,
    With other graces weigh'd.

MALCOLM

    But I have none: the king-becoming graces,
    As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,
    Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,
    Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,
    I have no relish of them, but abound
    In the division of each several crime,
    Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should
    Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,
    Uproar the universal peace, confound
    All unity on earth.

MACDUFF

    O Scotland, Scotland!

MALCOLM

    If such a one be fit to govern, speak:
    I am as I have spoken.

MACDUFF

    Fit to govern!
    No, not to live. O nation miserable,
    With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,
    When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,
    Since that the truest issue of thy throne
    By his own interdiction stands accursed,
    And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father
    Was a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee,
    Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,
    Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!
    These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself
    Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast,
    Thy hope ends here!

MALCOLM

    Macduff, this noble passion,
    Child of integrity, hath from my soul
    Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts
    To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth
    By many of these trains hath sought to win me
    Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me
    From over-credulous haste: but God above
    Deal between thee and me! for even now
    I put myself to thy direction, and
    Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure
    The taints and blames I laid upon myself,
    For strangers to my nature. I am yet
    Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
    Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,
    At no time broke my faith, would not betray
    The devil to his fellow and delight
    No less in truth than life: my first false speaking
    Was this upon myself: what I am truly,
    Is thine and my poor country's to command:
    Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,
    Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,
    Already at a point, was setting forth.
    Now we'll together; and the chance of goodness
    Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?

MACDUFF

    Such welcome and unwelcome things at once
    'Tis hard to reconcile.

    Enter a Doctor

MALCOLM

    Well; more anon.--Comes the king forth, I pray you?

Doctor

    Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls
    That stay his cure: their malady convinces
    The great assay of art; but at his touch--
    Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand--
    They presently amend.

MALCOLM

    I thank you, doctor.

    Exit Doctor

MACDUFF

    What's the disease he means?

MALCOLM

    'Tis call'd the evil:
    A most miraculous work in this good king;
    Which often, since my here-remain in England,
    I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,
    Himself best knows: but strangely-visited people,
    All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,
    The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
    Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,
    Put on with holy prayers: and 'tis spoken,
    To the succeeding royalty he leaves
    The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,
    He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,
    And sundry blessings hang about his throne,
    That speak him full of grace.

    Enter ROSS

MACDUFF

    See, who comes here?

MALCOLM

    My countryman; but yet I know him not.

MACDUFF

    My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.

MALCOLM

    I know him now. Good God, betimes remove
    The means that makes us strangers!

ROSS

    Sir, amen.

MACDUFF

    Stands Scotland where it did?

ROSS

    Alas, poor country!
    Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot
    Be call'd our mother, but our grave; where nothing,
    But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;
    Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air
    Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems
    A modern ecstasy; the dead man's knell
    Is there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives
    Expire before the flowers in their caps,
    Dying or ere they sicken.

MACDUFF

    O, relation
    Too nice, and yet too true!

MALCOLM

    What's the newest grief?

ROSS

    That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker:
    Each minute teems a new one.

MACDUFF

    How does my wife?

ROSS

    Why, well.

MACDUFF

    And all my children?

ROSS

    Well too.

MACDUFF

    The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?

ROSS

    No; they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.

MACDUFF

    But not a niggard of your speech: how goes't?

ROSS

    When I came hither to transport the tidings,
    Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour
    Of many worthy fellows that were out;
    Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,
    For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot:
    Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland
    Would create soldiers, make our women fight,
    To doff their dire distresses.

MALCOLM

    Be't their comfort
    We are coming thither: gracious England hath
    Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;
    An older and a better soldier none
    That Christendom gives out.

ROSS

    Would I could answer
    This comfort with the like! But I have words
    That would be howl'd out in the desert air,
    Where hearing should not latch them.

MACDUFF

    What concern they?
    The general cause? or is it a fee-grief
    Due to some single breast?

ROSS

    No mind that's honest
    But in it shares some woe; though the main part
    Pertains to you alone.

MACDUFF

    If it be mine,
    Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.

ROSS

    Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,
    Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
    That ever yet they heard.

MACDUFF

    Hum! I guess at it.

ROSS

    Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes
    Savagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner,
    Were, on the quarry of these murder'd deer,
    To add the death of you.

MALCOLM

    Merciful heaven!
    What, man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows;
    Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak
    Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.

MACDUFF

    My children too?

ROSS

    Wife, children, servants, all
    That could be found.

MACDUFF

    And I must be from thence!
    My wife kill'd too?

ROSS

    I have said.

MALCOLM

    Be comforted:
    Let's make us medicines of our great revenge,
    To cure this deadly grief.

MACDUFF

    He has no children. All my pretty ones?
    Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?
    What, all my pretty chickens and their dam
    At one fell swoop?

MALCOLM

    Dispute it like a man.

MACDUFF

    I shall do so;
    But I must also feel it as a man:
    I cannot but remember such things were,
    That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,
    And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,
    They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,
    Not for their own demerits, but for mine,
    Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!

MALCOLM

    Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief
    Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.

MACDUFF

    O, I could play the woman with mine eyes
    And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,
    Cut short all intermission; front to front
    Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;
    Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,
    Heaven forgive him too!

MALCOLM

    This tune goes manly.
    Come, go we to the king; our power is ready;
    Our lack is nothing but our leave; Macbeth
    Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above
    Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may:
    The night is long that never finds the day.

    Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. Dunsinane. Ante-room in the castle.

    Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman 

Doctor

    I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive
    no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?

Gentlewoman

    Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen
    her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon
    her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,
    write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again
    return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.

Doctor

    A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once
    the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of
    watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her
    walking and other actual performances, what, at any
    time, have you heard her say?

Gentlewoman

    That, sir, which I will not report after her.

Doctor

    You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.

Gentlewoman

    Neither to you nor any one; having no witness to
    confirm my speech.

    Enter LADY MACBETH, with a taper
    Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise;
    and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.

Doctor

    How came she by that light?

Gentlewoman

    Why, it stood by her: she has light by her
    continually; 'tis her command.

Doctor

    You see, her eyes are open.

Gentlewoman

    Ay, but their sense is shut.

Doctor

    What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands.

Gentlewoman

    It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus
    washing her hands: I have known her continue in
    this a quarter of an hour.

LADY MACBETH

    Yet here's a spot.

Doctor

    Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from
    her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.

LADY MACBETH

    Out, damned spot! out, I say!--One: two: why,
    then, 'tis time to do't.--Hell is murky!--Fie, my
    lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we
    fear who knows it, when none can call our power to
    account?--Yet who would have thought the old man
    to have had so much blood in him.

Doctor

    Do you mark that?

LADY MACBETH

    The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?--
    What, will these hands ne'er be clean?--No more o'
    that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with
    this starting.

Doctor

    Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.

Gentlewoman

    She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of
    that: heaven knows what she has known.

LADY MACBETH

    Here's the smell of the blood still: all the
    perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little
    hand. Oh, oh, oh!

Doctor

    What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.

Gentlewoman

    I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the
    dignity of the whole body.

Doctor

    Well, well, well,--

Gentlewoman

    Pray God it be, sir.

Doctor

    This disease is beyond my practise: yet I have known
    those which have walked in their sleep who have died
    holily in their beds.

LADY MACBETH

    Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so
    pale.--I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he
    cannot come out on's grave.

Doctor

    Even so?

LADY MACBETH

    To bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate:
    come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What's
    done cannot be undone.--To bed, to bed, to bed!

    Exit

Doctor

    Will she go now to bed?

Gentlewoman

    Directly.

Doctor

    Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds
    Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds
    To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets:
    More needs she the divine than the physician.
    God, God forgive us all! Look after her;
    Remove from her the means of all annoyance,
    And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:
    My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.
    I think, but dare not speak.

Gentlewoman

    Good night, good doctor.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. The country near Dunsinane.

    Drum and colours. Enter MENTEITH, CAITHNESS, ANGUS, LENNOX, and Soldiers 

MENTEITH

    The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,
    His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:
    Revenges burn in them; for their dear causes
    Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
    Excite the mortified man.

ANGUS

    Near Birnam wood
    Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming.

CAITHNESS

    Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?

LENNOX

    For certain, sir, he is not: I have a file
    Of all the gentry: there is Siward's son,
    And many unrough youths that even now
    Protest their first of manhood.

MENTEITH

    What does the tyrant?

CAITHNESS

    Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies:
    Some say he's mad; others that lesser hate him
    Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain,
    He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause
    Within the belt of rule.

ANGUS

    Now does he feel
    His secret murders sticking on his hands;
    Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;
    Those he commands move only in command,
    Nothing in love: now does he feel his title
    Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe
    Upon a dwarfish thief.

MENTEITH

    Who then shall blame
    His pester'd senses to recoil and start,
    When all that is within him does condemn
    Itself for being there?

CAITHNESS

    Well, march we on,
    To give obedience where 'tis truly owed:
    Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal,
    And with him pour we in our country's purge
    Each drop of us.

LENNOX

    Or so much as it needs,
    To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.
    Make we our march towards Birnam.

    Exeunt, marching

SCENE III. Dunsinane. A room in the castle.

    Enter MACBETH, Doctor, and Attendants 

MACBETH

    Bring me no more reports; let them fly all:
    Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane,
    I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm?
    Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know
    All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:
    'Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman
    Shall e'er have power upon thee.' Then fly,
    false thanes,
    And mingle with the English epicures:
    The mind I sway by and the heart I bear
    Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.

    Enter a Servant
    The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!
    Where got'st thou that goose look?

Servant

    There is ten thousand--

MACBETH

    Geese, villain!

Servant

    Soldiers, sir.

MACBETH

    Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,
    Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch?
    Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine
    Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?

Servant

    The English force, so please you.

MACBETH

    Take thy face hence.

    Exit Servant
    Seyton!--I am sick at heart,
    When I behold--Seyton, I say!--This push
    Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now.
    I have lived long enough: my way of life
    Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf;
    And that which should accompany old age,
    As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,
    I must not look to have; but, in their stead,
    Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,
    Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not. Seyton!

    Enter SEYTON

SEYTON

    What is your gracious pleasure?

MACBETH

    What news more?

SEYTON

    All is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported.

MACBETH

    I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd.
    Give me my armour.

SEYTON

    'Tis not needed yet.

MACBETH

    I'll put it on.
    Send out more horses; skirr the country round;
    Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.
    How does your patient, doctor?

Doctor

    Not so sick, my lord,
    As she is troubled with thick coming fancies,
    That keep her from her rest.

MACBETH

    Cure her of that.
    Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,
    Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,
    Raze out the written troubles of the brain
    And with some sweet oblivious antidote
    Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff
    Which weighs upon the heart?

Doctor

    Therein the patient
    Must minister to himself.

MACBETH

    Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it.
    Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff.
    Seyton, send out. Doctor, the thanes fly from me.
    Come, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor, cast
    The water of my land, find her disease,
    And purge it to a sound and pristine health,
    I would applaud thee to the very echo,
    That should applaud again.--Pull't off, I say.--
    What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug,
    Would scour these English hence? Hear'st thou of them?

Doctor

    Ay, my good lord; your royal preparation
    Makes us hear something.

MACBETH

    Bring it after me.
    I will not be afraid of death and bane,
    Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.

Doctor

    [Aside] Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,
    Profit again should hardly draw me here.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. Country near Birnam wood.

    Drum and colours. Enter MALCOLM, SIWARD and YOUNG SIWARD, MACDUFF, MENTEITH, CAITHNESS, ANGUS, LENNOX, ROSS, and Soldiers, marching 

MALCOLM

    Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand
    That chambers will be safe.

MENTEITH

    We doubt it nothing.

SIWARD

    What wood is this before us?

MENTEITH

    The wood of Birnam.

MALCOLM

    Let every soldier hew him down a bough
    And bear't before him: thereby shall we shadow
    The numbers of our host and make discovery
    Err in report of us.

Soldiers

    It shall be done.

SIWARD

    We learn no other but the confident tyrant
    Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure
    Our setting down before 't.

MALCOLM

    'Tis his main hope:
    For where there is advantage to be given,
    Both more and less have given him the revolt,
    And none serve with him but constrained things
    Whose hearts are absent too.

MACDUFF

    Let our just censures
    Attend the true event, and put we on
    Industrious soldiership.

SIWARD

    The time approaches
    That will with due decision make us know
    What we shall say we have and what we owe.
    Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,
    But certain issue strokes must arbitrate:
    Towards which advance the war.

    Exeunt, marching

SCENE V. Dunsinane. Within the castle.

    Enter MACBETH, SEYTON, and Soldiers, with drum and colours 

MACBETH

    Hang out our banners on the outward walls;
    The cry is still 'They come:' our castle's strength
    Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie
    Till famine and the ague eat them up:
    Were they not forced with those that should be ours,
    We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,
    And beat them backward home.

    A cry of women within
    What is that noise?

SEYTON

    It is the cry of women, my good lord.

    Exit

MACBETH

    I have almost forgot the taste of fears;
    The time has been, my senses would have cool'd
    To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair
    Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
    As life were in't: I have supp'd full with horrors;
    Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts
    Cannot once start me.

    Re-enter SEYTON
    Wherefore was that cry?

SEYTON

    The queen, my lord, is dead.

MACBETH

    She should have died hereafter;
    There would have been a time for such a word.
    To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,
    Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
    To the last syllable of recorded time,
    And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
    The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
    Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
    That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
    And then is heard no more: it is a tale
    Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
    Signifying nothing.

    Enter a Messenger
    Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.

Messenger

    Gracious my lord,
    I should report that which I say I saw,
    But know not how to do it.

MACBETH

    Well, say, sir.

Messenger

    As I did stand my watch upon the hill,
    I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,
    The wood began to move.

MACBETH

    Liar and slave!

Messenger

    Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so:
    Within this three mile may you see it coming;
    I say, a moving grove.

MACBETH

    If thou speak'st false,
    Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,
    Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,
    I care not if thou dost for me as much.
    I pull in resolution, and begin
    To doubt the equivocation of the fiend
    That lies like truth: 'Fear not, till Birnam wood
    Do come to Dunsinane:' and now a wood
    Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!
    If this which he avouches does appear,
    There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.
    I gin to be aweary of the sun,
    And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.
    Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
    At least we'll die with harness on our back.

    Exeunt

SCENE VI. Dunsinane. Before the castle.

    Drum and colours. Enter MALCOLM, SIWARD, MACDUFF, and their Army, with boughs 

MALCOLM

    Now near enough: your leafy screens throw down.
    And show like those you are. You, worthy uncle,
    Shall, with my cousin, your right-noble son,
    Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we
    Shall take upon 's what else remains to do,
    According to our order.

SIWARD

    Fare you well.
    Do we but find the tyrant's power to-night,
    Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight.

MACDUFF

    Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,
    Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.

    Exeunt

SCENE VII. Another part of the field.

    Alarums. Enter MACBETH 

MACBETH

    They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,
    But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What's he
    That was not born of woman? Such a one
    Am I to fear, or none.

    Enter YOUNG SIWARD

YOUNG SIWARD

    What is thy name?

MACBETH

    Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.

YOUNG SIWARD

    No; though thou call'st thyself a hotter name
    Than any is in hell.

MACBETH

    My name's Macbeth.

YOUNG SIWARD

    The devil himself could not pronounce a title
    More hateful to mine ear.

MACBETH

    No, nor more fearful.

YOUNG SIWARD

    Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword
    I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.

    They fight and YOUNG SIWARD is slain

MACBETH

    Thou wast born of woman
    But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,
    Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.

    Exit

    Alarums. Enter MACDUFF

MACDUFF

    That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!
    If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine,
    My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.
    I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms
    Are hired to bear their staves: either thou, Macbeth,
    Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge
    I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;
    By this great clatter, one of greatest note
    Seems bruited. Let me find him, fortune!
    And more I beg not.

    Exit. Alarums

    Enter MALCOLM and SIWARD

SIWARD

    This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd:
    The tyrant's people on both sides do fight;
    The noble thanes do bravely in the war;
    The day almost itself professes yours,
    And little is to do.

MALCOLM

    We have met with foes
    That strike beside us.

SIWARD

    Enter, sir, the castle.

    Exeunt. Alarums

SCENE VIII. Another part of the field.

    Enter MACBETH 

MACBETH

    Why should I play the Roman fool, and die
    On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes
    Do better upon them.

    Enter MACDUFF

MACDUFF

    Turn, hell-hound, turn!

MACBETH

    Of all men else I have avoided thee:
    But get thee back; my soul is too much charged
    With blood of thine already.

MACDUFF

    I have no words:
    My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain
    Than terms can give thee out!

    They fight

MACBETH

    Thou losest labour:
    As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
    With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed:
    Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
    I bear a charmed life, which must not yield,
    To one of woman born.

MACDUFF

    Despair thy charm;
    And let the angel whom thou still hast served
    Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb
    Untimely ripp'd.

MACBETH

    Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,
    For it hath cow'd my better part of man!
    And be these juggling fiends no more believed,
    That palter with us in a double sense;
    That keep the word of promise to our ear,
    And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.

MACDUFF

    Then yield thee, coward,
    And live to be the show and gaze o' the time:
    We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,
    Painted on a pole, and underwrit,
    'Here may you see the tyrant.'

MACBETH

    I will not yield,
    To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,
    And to be baited with the rabble's curse.
    Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,
    And thou opposed, being of no woman born,
    Yet I will try the last. Before my body
    I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,
    And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!'

    Exeunt, fighting. Alarums

    Retreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colours, MALCOLM, SIWARD, ROSS, the other Thanes, and Soldiers

MALCOLM

    I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.

SIWARD

    Some must go off: and yet, by these I see,
    So great a day as this is cheaply bought.

MALCOLM

    Macduff is missing, and your noble son.

ROSS

    Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:
    He only lived but till he was a man;
    The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd
    In the unshrinking station where he fought,
    But like a man he died.

SIWARD

    Then he is dead?

ROSS

    Ay, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow
    Must not be measured by his worth, for then
    It hath no end.

SIWARD

    Had he his hurts before?

ROSS

    Ay, on the front.

SIWARD

    Why then, God's soldier be he!
    Had I as many sons as I have hairs,
    I would not wish them to a fairer death:
    And so, his knell is knoll'd.

MALCOLM

    He's worth more sorrow,
    And that I'll spend for him.

SIWARD

    He's worth no more
    They say he parted well, and paid his score:
    And so, God be with him! Here comes newer comfort.

    Re-enter MACDUFF, with MACBETH's head

MACDUFF

    Hail, king! for so thou art: behold, where stands
    The usurper's cursed head: the time is free:
    I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl,
    That speak my salutation in their minds;
    Whose voices I desire aloud with mine:
    Hail, King of Scotland!

ALL

    Hail, King of Scotland!

    Flourish

MALCOLM

    We shall not spend a large expense of time
    Before we reckon with your several loves,
    And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,
    Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland
    In such an honour named. What's more to do,
    Which would be planted newly with the time,
    As calling home our exiled friends abroad
    That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;
    Producing forth the cruel ministers
    Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,
    Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands
    Took off her life; this, and what needful else
    That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,
    We will perform in measure, time and place:
    So, thanks to all at once and to each one,
    Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.

    Flourish. Exeunt

ACT I
PROLOGUE

    Two households, both alike in dignity,
    In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
    From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
    Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
    From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
    A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
    Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
    Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
    The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
    And the continuance of their parents' rage,
    Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
    Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
    The which if you with patient ears attend,
    What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

SCENE I. Verona. A public place.

    Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers 

SAMPSON

    Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.

GREGORY

    No, for then we should be colliers.

SAMPSON

    I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.

GREGORY

    Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.

SAMPSON

    I strike quickly, being moved.

GREGORY

    But thou art not quickly moved to strike.

SAMPSON

    A dog of the house of Montague moves me.

GREGORY

    To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
    therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.

SAMPSON

    A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
    take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.

GREGORY

    That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
    to the wall.

SAMPSON

    True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
    are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
    Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
    to the wall.

GREGORY

    The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.

SAMPSON

    'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
    have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
    maids, and cut off their heads.

GREGORY

    The heads of the maids?

SAMPSON

    Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
    take it in what sense thou wilt.

GREGORY

    They must take it in sense that feel it.

SAMPSON

    Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
    'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.

GREGORY

    'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
    hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
    two of the house of the Montagues.

SAMPSON

    My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.

GREGORY

    How! turn thy back and run?

SAMPSON

    Fear me not.

GREGORY

    No, marry; I fear thee!

SAMPSON

    Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.

GREGORY

    I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
    they list.

SAMPSON

    Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
    which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.

    Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR

ABRAHAM

    Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

SAMPSON

    I do bite my thumb, sir.

ABRAHAM

    Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

SAMPSON

    [Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I say
    ay?

GREGORY

    No.

SAMPSON

    No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
    bite my thumb, sir.

GREGORY

    Do you quarrel, sir?

ABRAHAM

    Quarrel sir! no, sir.

SAMPSON

    If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.

ABRAHAM

    No better.

SAMPSON

    Well, sir.

GREGORY

    Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.

SAMPSON

    Yes, better, sir.

ABRAHAM

    You lie.

SAMPSON

    Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.

    They fight

    Enter BENVOLIO

BENVOLIO

    Part, fools!
    Put up your swords; you know not what you do.

    Beats down their swords

    Enter TYBALT

TYBALT

    What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
    Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.

BENVOLIO

    I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
    Or manage it to part these men with me.

TYBALT

    What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
    As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
    Have at thee, coward!

    They fight

    Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray; then enter Citizens, with clubs

First Citizen

    Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
    Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!

    Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET

CAPULET

    What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!

LADY CAPULET

    A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?

CAPULET

    My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
    And flourishes his blade in spite of me.

    Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE

MONTAGUE

    Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.

LADY MONTAGUE

    Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.

    Enter PRINCE, with Attendants

PRINCE

    Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
    Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
    Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
    That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
    With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
    On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
    Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
    And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
    Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
    By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
    Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
    And made Verona's ancient citizens
    Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
    To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
    Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
    If ever you disturb our streets again,
    Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
    For this time, all the rest depart away:
    You Capulet; shall go along with me:
    And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
    To know our further pleasure in this case,
    To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
    Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.

    Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO

MONTAGUE

    Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
    Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?

BENVOLIO

    Here were the servants of your adversary,
    And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
    I drew to part them: in the instant came
    The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
    Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
    He swung about his head and cut the winds,
    Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
    While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
    Came more and more and fought on part and part,
    Till the prince came, who parted either part.

LADY MONTAGUE

    O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
    Right glad I am he was not at this fray.

BENVOLIO

    Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
    Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
    A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
    Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
    That westward rooteth from the city's side,
    So early walking did I see your son:
    Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
    And stole into the covert of the wood:
    I, measuring his affections by my own,
    That most are busied when they're most alone,
    Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
    And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.

MONTAGUE

    Many a morning hath he there been seen,
    With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
    Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
    But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
    Should in the furthest east begin to draw
    The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
    Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
    And private in his chamber pens himself,
    Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
    And makes himself an artificial night:
    Black and portentous must this humour prove,
    Unless good counsel may the cause remove.

BENVOLIO

    My noble uncle, do you know the cause?

MONTAGUE

    I neither know it nor can learn of him.

BENVOLIO

    Have you importuned him by any means?

MONTAGUE

    Both by myself and many other friends:
    But he, his own affections' counsellor,
    Is to himself--I will not say how true--
    But to himself so secret and so close,
    So far from sounding and discovery,
    As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
    Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
    Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
    Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
    We would as willingly give cure as know.

    Enter ROMEO

BENVOLIO

    See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
    I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.

MONTAGUE

    I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
    To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.

    Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE

BENVOLIO

    Good-morrow, cousin.

ROMEO

    Is the day so young?

BENVOLIO

    But new struck nine.

ROMEO

    Ay me! sad hours seem long.
    Was that my father that went hence so fast?

BENVOLIO

    It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

ROMEO

    Not having that, which, having, makes them short.

BENVOLIO

    In love?

ROMEO

    Out--

BENVOLIO

    Of love?

ROMEO

    Out of her favour, where I am in love.

BENVOLIO

    Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
    Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!

ROMEO

    Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
    Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
    Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
    Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
    Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
    Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
    O any thing, of nothing first create!
    O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
    Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
    Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
    sick health!
    Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
    This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
    Dost thou not laugh?

BENVOLIO

    No, coz, I rather weep.

ROMEO

    Good heart, at what?

BENVOLIO

    At thy good heart's oppression.

ROMEO

    Why, such is love's transgression.
    Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
    Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
    With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
    Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
    Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
    Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
    Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
    What is it else? a madness most discreet,
    A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
    Farewell, my coz.

BENVOLIO

    Soft! I will go along;
    An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.

ROMEO

    Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
    This is not Romeo, he's some other where.

BENVOLIO

    Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.

ROMEO

    What, shall I groan and tell thee?

BENVOLIO

    Groan! why, no.
    But sadly tell me who.

ROMEO

    Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
    Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
    In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

BENVOLIO

    I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.

ROMEO

    A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.

BENVOLIO

    A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

ROMEO

    Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
    With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
    And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
    From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
    She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
    Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
    Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
    O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
    That when she dies with beauty dies her store.

BENVOLIO

    Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?

ROMEO

    She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
    For beauty starved with her severity
    Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
    She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
    To merit bliss by making me despair:
    She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
    Do I live dead that live to tell it now.

BENVOLIO

    Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.

ROMEO

    O, teach me how I should forget to think.

BENVOLIO

    By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
    Examine other beauties.

ROMEO

    'Tis the way
    To call hers exquisite, in question more:
    These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
    Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
    He that is strucken blind cannot forget
    The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
    Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
    What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
    Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
    Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.

BENVOLIO

    I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A street.

    Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant 

CAPULET

    But Montague is bound as well as I,
    In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
    For men so old as we to keep the peace.

PARIS

    Of honourable reckoning are you both;
    And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
    But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?

CAPULET

    But saying o'er what I have said before:
    My child is yet a stranger in the world;
    She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
    Let two more summers wither in their pride,
    Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

PARIS

    Younger than she are happy mothers made.

CAPULET

    And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
    The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
    She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
    But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
    My will to her consent is but a part;
    An she agree, within her scope of choice
    Lies my consent and fair according voice.
    This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
    Whereto I have invited many a guest,
    Such as I love; and you, among the store,
    One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
    At my poor house look to behold this night
    Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
    Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
    When well-apparell'd April on the heel
    Of limping winter treads, even such delight
    Among fresh female buds shall you this night
    Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
    And like her most whose merit most shall be:
    Which on more view, of many mine being one
    May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
    Come, go with me.

    To Servant, giving a paper
    Go, sirrah, trudge about
    Through fair Verona; find those persons out
    Whose names are written there, and to them say,
    My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.

    Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS

Servant

    Find them out whose names are written here! It is
    written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
    yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
    his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
    sent to find those persons whose names are here
    writ, and can never find what names the writing
    person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.

    Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO

BENVOLIO

    Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
    One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
    Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
    One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
    Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
    And the rank poison of the old will die.

ROMEO

    Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.

BENVOLIO

    For what, I pray thee?

ROMEO

    For your broken shin.

BENVOLIO

    Why, Romeo, art thou mad?

ROMEO

    Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
    Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
    Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.

Servant

    God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?

ROMEO

    Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.

Servant

    Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
    pray, can you read any thing you see?

ROMEO

    Ay, if I know the letters and the language.

Servant

    Ye say honestly: rest you merry!

ROMEO

    Stay, fellow; I can read.

    Reads
    'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
    County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
    widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
    nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
    uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece
    Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
    Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
    assembly: whither should they come?

Servant

    Up.

ROMEO

    Whither?

Servant

    To supper; to our house.

ROMEO

    Whose house?

Servant

    My master's.

ROMEO

    Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.

Servant

    Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
    great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house
    of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
    Rest you merry!

    Exit

BENVOLIO

    At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
    Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
    With all the admired beauties of Verona:
    Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
    Compare her face with some that I shall show,
    And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.

ROMEO

    When the devout religion of mine eye
    Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
    And these, who often drown'd could never die,
    Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
    One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
    Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.

BENVOLIO

    Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
    Herself poised with herself in either eye:
    But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
    Your lady's love against some other maid
    That I will show you shining at this feast,
    And she shall scant show well that now shows best.

ROMEO

    I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
    But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. A room in Capulet's house.

    Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse 

LADY CAPULET

    Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.

Nurse

    Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
    I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
    God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!

    Enter JULIET

JULIET

    How now! who calls?

Nurse

    Your mother.

JULIET

    Madam, I am here.
    What is your will?

LADY CAPULET

    This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
    We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
    I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
    Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.

Nurse

    Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.

LADY CAPULET

    She's not fourteen.

Nurse

    I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
    And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
    She is not fourteen. How long is it now
    To Lammas-tide?

LADY CAPULET

    A fortnight and odd days.

Nurse

    Even or odd, of all days in the year,
    Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
    Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
    Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
    She was too good for me: but, as I said,
    On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
    That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
    'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
    And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
    Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
    For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
    Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
    My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
    Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
    When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
    Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
    To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
    Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
    To bid me trudge:
    And since that time it is eleven years;
    For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
    She could have run and waddled all about;
    For even the day before, she broke her brow:
    And then my husband--God be with his soul!
    A' was a merry man--took up the child:
    'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
    Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
    Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
    The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
    To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
    I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
    I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
    And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'

LADY CAPULET

    Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.

Nurse

    Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
    To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
    And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
    A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
    A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
    'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
    Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
    Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'

JULIET

    And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.

Nurse

    Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
    Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
    An I might live to see thee married once,
    I have my wish.

LADY CAPULET

    Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
    I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
    How stands your disposition to be married?

JULIET

    It is an honour that I dream not of.

Nurse

    An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
    I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.

LADY CAPULET

    Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
    Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
    Are made already mothers: by my count,
    I was your mother much upon these years
    That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
    The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

Nurse

    A man, young lady! lady, such a man
    As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.

LADY CAPULET

    Verona's summer hath not such a flower.

Nurse

    Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.

LADY CAPULET

    What say you? can you love the gentleman?
    This night you shall behold him at our feast;
    Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
    And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
    Examine every married lineament,
    And see how one another lends content
    And what obscured in this fair volume lies
    Find written in the margent of his eyes.
    This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
    To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
    The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
    For fair without the fair within to hide:
    That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
    That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
    So shall you share all that he doth possess,
    By having him, making yourself no less.

Nurse

    No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.

LADY CAPULET

    Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?

JULIET

    I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
    But no more deep will I endart mine eye
    Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.

    Enter a Servant

Servant

    Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
    called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in
    the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must
    hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.

LADY CAPULET

    We follow thee.

    Exit Servant
    Juliet, the county stays.

Nurse

    Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. A street.

    Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others 

ROMEO

    What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
    Or shall we on without a apology?

BENVOLIO

    The date is out of such prolixity:
    We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
    Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
    Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
    Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
    After the prompter, for our entrance:
    But let them measure us by what they will;
    We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.

ROMEO

    Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
    Being but heavy, I will bear the light.

MERCUTIO

    Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.

ROMEO

    Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
    With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
    So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.

MERCUTIO

    You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
    And soar with them above a common bound.

ROMEO

    I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
    To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
    I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
    Under love's heavy burden do I sink.

MERCUTIO

    And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
    Too great oppression for a tender thing.

ROMEO

    Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
    Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.

MERCUTIO

    If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
    Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
    Give me a case to put my visage in:
    A visor for a visor! what care I
    What curious eye doth quote deformities?
    Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.

BENVOLIO

    Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
    But every man betake him to his legs.

ROMEO

    A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
    Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
    For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
    I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
    The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.

MERCUTIO

    Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
    If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
    Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
    Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!

ROMEO

    Nay, that's not so.

MERCUTIO

    I mean, sir, in delay
    We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
    Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
    Five times in that ere once in our five wits.

ROMEO

    And we mean well in going to this mask;
    But 'tis no wit to go.

MERCUTIO

    Why, may one ask?

ROMEO

    I dream'd a dream to-night.

MERCUTIO

    And so did I.

ROMEO

    Well, what was yours?

MERCUTIO

    That dreamers often lie.

ROMEO

    In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.

MERCUTIO

    O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
    She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
    In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
    On the fore-finger of an alderman,
    Drawn with a team of little atomies
    Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
    Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
    The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
    The traces of the smallest spider's web,
    The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
    Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
    Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
    Not so big as a round little worm
    Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
    Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
    Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
    Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
    And in this state she gallops night by night
    Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
    O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
    O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
    O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
    Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
    Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
    Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
    And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
    And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
    Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
    Then dreams, he of another benefice:
    Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
    And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
    Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
    Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
    Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
    And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
    And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
    That plats the manes of horses in the night,
    And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
    Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
    This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
    That presses them and learns them first to bear,
    Making them women of good carriage:
    This is she--

ROMEO

    Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
    Thou talk'st of nothing.

MERCUTIO

    True, I talk of dreams,
    Which are the children of an idle brain,
    Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
    Which is as thin of substance as the air
    And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
    Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
    And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
    Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.

BENVOLIO

    This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
    Supper is done, and we shall come too late.

ROMEO

    I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
    Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
    Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
    With this night's revels and expire the term
    Of a despised life closed in my breast
    By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
    But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
    Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.

BENVOLIO

    Strike, drum.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. A hall in Capulet's house.

    Musicians waiting. Enter Servingmen with napkins 

First Servant

    Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
    shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!

Second Servant

    When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
    hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.

First Servant

    Away with the joint-stools, remove the
    court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
    me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let
    the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
    Antony, and Potpan!

Second Servant

    Ay, boy, ready.

First Servant

    You are looked for and called for, asked for and
    sought for, in the great chamber.

Second Servant

    We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
    brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.

    Enter CAPULET, with JULIET and others of his house, meeting the Guests and Maskers

CAPULET

    Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
    Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
    Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
    Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
    She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
    Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
    That I have worn a visor and could tell
    A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
    Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
    You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
    A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.

    Music plays, and they dance
    More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
    And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
    Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
    Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
    For you and I are past our dancing days:
    How long is't now since last yourself and I
    Were in a mask?

Second Capulet

    By'r lady, thirty years.

CAPULET

    What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
    'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
    Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
    Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.

Second Capulet

    'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
    His son is thirty.

CAPULET

    Will you tell me that?
    His son was but a ward two years ago.

ROMEO

    [To a Servingman] What lady is that, which doth
    enrich the hand
    Of yonder knight?

Servant

    I know not, sir.

ROMEO

    O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
    It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
    Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
    Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
    So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
    As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
    The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
    And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
    Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
    For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.

TYBALT

    This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
    Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
    Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
    To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
    Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
    To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.

CAPULET

    Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?

TYBALT

    Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
    A villain that is hither come in spite,
    To scorn at our solemnity this night.

CAPULET

    Young Romeo is it?

TYBALT

    'Tis he, that villain Romeo.

CAPULET

    Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
    He bears him like a portly gentleman;
    And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
    To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
    I would not for the wealth of all the town
    Here in my house do him disparagement:
    Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
    It is my will, the which if thou respect,
    Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
    And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.

TYBALT

    It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
    I'll not endure him.

CAPULET

    He shall be endured:
    What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
    Am I the master here, or you? go to.
    You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
    You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
    You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!

TYBALT

    Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.

CAPULET

    Go to, go to;
    You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
    This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
    You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
    Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
    Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
    I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!

TYBALT

    Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
    Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
    I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
    Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.

    Exit

ROMEO

    [To JULIET] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
    This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
    My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
    To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.

JULIET

    Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
    Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
    For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
    And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

ROMEO

    Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

JULIET

    Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

ROMEO

    O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
    They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

JULIET

    Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.

ROMEO

    Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
    Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.

JULIET

    Then have my lips the sin that they have took.

ROMEO

    Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
    Give me my sin again.

JULIET

    You kiss by the book.

Nurse

    Madam, your mother craves a word with you.

ROMEO

    What is her mother?

Nurse

    Marry, bachelor,
    Her mother is the lady of the house,
    And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
    I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
    I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
    Shall have the chinks.

ROMEO

    Is she a Capulet?
    O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.

BENVOLIO

    Away, begone; the sport is at the best.

ROMEO

    Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.

CAPULET

    Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
    We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
    Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
    I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
    More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
    Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
    I'll to my rest.

    Exeunt all but JULIET and Nurse

JULIET

    Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?

Nurse

    The son and heir of old Tiberio.

JULIET

    What's he that now is going out of door?

Nurse

    Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.

JULIET

    What's he that follows there, that would not dance?

Nurse

    I know not.

JULIET

    Go ask his name: if he be married.
    My grave is like to be my wedding bed.

Nurse

    His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
    The only son of your great enemy.

JULIET

    My only love sprung from my only hate!
    Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
    Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
    That I must love a loathed enemy.

Nurse

    What's this? what's this?

JULIET

    A rhyme I learn'd even now
    Of one I danced withal.

    One calls within 'Juliet.'

Nurse

    Anon, anon!
    Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.

    Exeunt

ACT II
PROLOGUE

    Enter Chorus 

Chorus

    Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
    And young affection gapes to be his heir;
    That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
    With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
    Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
    Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
    But to his foe supposed he must complain,
    And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
    Being held a foe, he may not have access
    To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
    And she as much in love, her means much less
    To meet her new-beloved any where:
    But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
    Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.

    Exit

SCENE I. A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.

    Enter ROMEO 

ROMEO

    Can I go forward when my heart is here?
    Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.

    He climbs the wall, and leaps down within it

    Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO

BENVOLIO

    Romeo! my cousin Romeo!

MERCUTIO

    He is wise;
    And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.

BENVOLIO

    He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
    Call, good Mercutio.

MERCUTIO

    Nay, I'll conjure too.
    Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
    Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
    Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
    Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
    Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
    One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
    Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
    When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
    He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
    The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
    I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
    By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
    By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
    And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
    That in thy likeness thou appear to us!

BENVOLIO

    And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.

MERCUTIO

    This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
    To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
    Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
    Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
    That were some spite: my invocation
    Is fair and honest, and in his mistres s' name
    I conjure only but to raise up him.

BENVOLIO

    Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
    To be consorted with the humorous night:
    Blind is his love and best befits the dark.

MERCUTIO

    If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
    Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
    And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
    As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
    Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
    An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
    Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
    This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
    Come, shall we go?

BENVOLIO

    Go, then; for 'tis in vain
    To seek him here that means not to be found.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.

    Enter ROMEO 

ROMEO

    He jests at scars that never felt a wound.

    JULIET appears above at a window
    But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
    It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
    Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
    Who is already sick and pale with grief,
    That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
    Be not her maid, since she is envious;
    Her vestal livery is but sick and green
    And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
    It is my lady, O, it is my love!
    O, that she knew she were!
    She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
    Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
    I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
    Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
    Having some business, do entreat her eyes
    To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
    What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
    The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
    As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
    Would through the airy region stream so bright
    That birds would sing and think it were not night.
    See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
    O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
    That I might touch that cheek!

JULIET

    Ay me!

ROMEO

    She speaks:
    O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
    As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
    As is a winged messenger of heaven
    Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
    Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
    When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
    And sails upon the bosom of the air.

JULIET

    O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
    Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
    Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
    And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

ROMEO

    [Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?

JULIET

    'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
    Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
    What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
    Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
    Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
    What's in a name? that which we call a rose
    By any other name would smell as sweet;
    So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
    Retain that dear perfection which he owes
    Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
    And for that name which is no part of thee
    Take all myself.

ROMEO

    I take thee at thy word:
    Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
    Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

JULIET

    What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
    So stumblest on my counsel?

ROMEO

    By a name
    I know not how to tell thee who I am:
    My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
    Because it is an enemy to thee;
    Had I it written, I would tear the word.

JULIET

    My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
    Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
    Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?

ROMEO

    Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.

JULIET

    How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
    The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
    And the place death, considering who thou art,
    If any of my kinsmen find thee here.

ROMEO

    With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
    For stony limits cannot hold love out,
    And what love can do that dares love attempt;
    Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.

JULIET

    If they do see thee, they will murder thee.

ROMEO

    Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
    Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
    And I am proof against their enmity.

JULIET

    I would not for the world they saw thee here.

ROMEO

    I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
    And but thou love me, let them find me here:
    My life were better ended by their hate,
    Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.

JULIET

    By whose direction found'st thou out this place?

ROMEO

    By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
    He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
    I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
    As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
    I would adventure for such merchandise.

JULIET

    Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
    Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
    For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
    Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
    What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
    Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
    And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
    Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
    Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
    If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
    Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
    I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
    So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
    In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
    And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
    But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
    Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
    I should have been more strange, I must confess,
    But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
    My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
    And not impute this yielding to light love,
    Which the dark night hath so discovered.

ROMEO

    Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
    That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--

JULIET

    O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
    That monthly changes in her circled orb,
    Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

ROMEO

    What shall I swear by?

JULIET

    Do not swear at all;
    Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
    Which is the god of my idolatry,
    And I'll believe thee.

ROMEO

    If my heart's dear love--

JULIET

    Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
    I have no joy of this contract to-night:
    It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
    Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
    Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
    This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
    May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
    Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
    Come to thy heart as that within my breast!

ROMEO

    O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

JULIET

    What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?

ROMEO

    The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.

JULIET

    I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
    And yet I would it were to give again.

ROMEO

    Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?

JULIET

    But to be frank, and give it thee again.
    And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
    My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
    My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
    The more I have, for both are infinite.

    Nurse calls within
    I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
    Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
    Stay but a little, I will come again.

    Exit, above

ROMEO

    O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
    Being in night, all this is but a dream,
    Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.

    Re-enter JULIET, above

JULIET

    Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
    If that thy bent of love be honourable,
    Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
    By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
    Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
    And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
    And follow thee my lord throughout the world.

Nurse

    [Within] Madam!

JULIET

    I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
    I do beseech thee--

Nurse

    [Within] Madam!

JULIET

    By and by, I come:--
    To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
    To-morrow will I send.

ROMEO

    So thrive my soul--

JULIET

    A thousand times good night!

    Exit, above

ROMEO

    A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
    Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
    their books,
    But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.

    Retiring

    Re-enter JULIET, above

JULIET

    Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
    To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
    Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
    Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
    And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
    With repetition of my Romeo's name.

ROMEO

    It is my soul that calls upon my name:
    How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
    Like softest music to attending ears!

JULIET

    Romeo!

ROMEO

    My dear?

JULIET

    At what o'clock to-morrow
    Shall I send to thee?

ROMEO

    At the hour of nine.

JULIET

    I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
    I have forgot why I did call thee back.

ROMEO

    Let me stand here till thou remember it.

JULIET

    I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
    Remembering how I love thy company.

ROMEO

    And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
    Forgetting any other home but this.

JULIET

    'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
    And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
    Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
    Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
    And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
    So loving-jealous of his liberty.

ROMEO

    I would I were thy bird.

JULIET

    Sweet, so would I:
    Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
    Good night, good night! parting is such
    sweet sorrow,
    That I shall say good night till it be morrow.

    Exit above

ROMEO

    Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
    Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
    Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
    His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.

    Exit

SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.

    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basket 

FRIAR LAURENCE

    The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
    Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
    And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
    From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
    Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
    The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
    I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
    With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
    The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
    What is her burying grave that is her womb,
    And from her womb children of divers kind
    We sucking on her natural bosom find,
    Many for many virtues excellent,
    None but for some and yet all different.
    O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
    In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
    For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
    But to the earth some special good doth give,
    Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
    Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
    Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
    And vice sometimes by action dignified.
    Within the infant rind of this small flower
    Poison hath residence and medicine power:
    For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
    Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
    Two such opposed kings encamp them still
    In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
    And where the worser is predominant,
    Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.

    Enter ROMEO

ROMEO

    Good morrow, father.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Benedicite!
    What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
    Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
    So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
    Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
    And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
    But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
    Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
    Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
    Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
    Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
    Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.

ROMEO

    That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?

ROMEO

    With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
    I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?

ROMEO

    I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
    I have been feasting with mine enemy,
    Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
    That's by me wounded: both our remedies
    Within thy help and holy physic lies:
    I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
    My intercession likewise steads my foe.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
    Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.

ROMEO

    Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
    On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
    As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
    And all combined, save what thou must combine
    By holy marriage: when and where and how
    We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
    I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
    That thou consent to marry us to-day.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
    Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
    So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
    Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
    Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
    Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
    How much salt water thrown away in waste,
    To season love, that of it doth not taste!
    The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
    Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
    Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
    Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
    If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
    Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
    And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
    Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.

ROMEO

    Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.

ROMEO

    And bad'st me bury love.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Not in a grave,
    To lay one in, another out to have.

ROMEO

    I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
    Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
    The other did not so.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    O, she knew well
    Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
    But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
    In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
    For this alliance may so happy prove,
    To turn your households' rancour to pure love.

ROMEO

    O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. A street.

    Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO 

MERCUTIO

    Where the devil should this Romeo be?
    Came he not home to-night?

BENVOLIO

    Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.

MERCUTIO

    Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
    Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.

BENVOLIO

    Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
    Hath sent a letter to his father's house.

MERCUTIO

    A challenge, on my life.

BENVOLIO

    Romeo will answer it.

MERCUTIO

    Any man that can write may answer a letter.

BENVOLIO

    Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
    dares, being dared.

MERCUTIO

    Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
    white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
    love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
    blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
    encounter Tybalt?

BENVOLIO

    Why, what is Tybalt?

MERCUTIO

    More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
    the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
    you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
    proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
    the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
    button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
    very first house, of the first and second cause:
    ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
    hai!

BENVOLIO

    The what?

MERCUTIO

    The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
    fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
    a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
    whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
    grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
    these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
    perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
    that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
    bones, their bones!

    Enter ROMEO

BENVOLIO

    Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.

MERCUTIO

    Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
    how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
    that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
    kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
    be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
    Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
    eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
    Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
    to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
    fairly last night.

ROMEO

    Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?

MERCUTIO

    The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?

ROMEO

    Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in
    such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.

MERCUTIO

    That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
    constrains a man to bow in the hams.

ROMEO

    Meaning, to court'sy.

MERCUTIO

    Thou hast most kindly hit it.

ROMEO

    A most courteous exposition.

MERCUTIO

    Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.

ROMEO

    Pink for flower.

MERCUTIO

    Right.

ROMEO

    Why, then is my pump well flowered.

MERCUTIO

    Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
    worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
    is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.

ROMEO

    O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
    singleness.

MERCUTIO

    Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.

ROMEO

    Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.

MERCUTIO

    Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
    done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
    thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
    was I with you there for the goose?

ROMEO

    Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
    not there for the goose.

MERCUTIO

    I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.

ROMEO

    Nay, good goose, bite not.

MERCUTIO

    Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
    sharp sauce.

ROMEO

    And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?

MERCUTIO

    O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
    inch narrow to an ell broad!

ROMEO

    I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
    to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.

MERCUTIO

    Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
    now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
    thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
    for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
    that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.

BENVOLIO

    Stop there, stop there.

MERCUTIO

    Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.

BENVOLIO

    Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.

MERCUTIO

    O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
    for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
    meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.

ROMEO

    Here's goodly gear!

    Enter Nurse and PETER

MERCUTIO

    A sail, a sail!

BENVOLIO

    Two, two; a shirt and a smock.

Nurse

    Peter!

PETER

    Anon!

Nurse

    My fan, Peter.

MERCUTIO

    Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
    fairer face.

Nurse

    God ye good morrow, gentlemen.

MERCUTIO

    God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.

Nurse

    Is it good den?

MERCUTIO

    'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
    dial is now upon the prick of noon.

Nurse

    Out upon you! what a man are you!

ROMEO

    One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
    mar.

Nurse

    By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
    quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
    may find the young Romeo?

ROMEO

    I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
    you have found him than he was when you sought him:
    I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.

Nurse

    You say well.

MERCUTIO

    Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
    wisely, wisely.

Nurse

    if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
    you.

BENVOLIO

    She will indite him to some supper.

MERCUTIO

    A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!

ROMEO

    What hast thou found?

MERCUTIO

    No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
    that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.

    Sings
    An old hare hoar,
    And an old hare hoar,
    Is very good meat in lent
    But a hare that is hoar
    Is too much for a score,
    When it hoars ere it be spent.
    Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
    to dinner, thither.

ROMEO

    I will follow you.

MERCUTIO

    Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,

    Singing
    'lady, lady, lady.'

    Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO

Nurse

    Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
    merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?

ROMEO

    A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
    and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
    to in a month.

Nurse

    An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
    down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
    Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
    Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
    none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
    too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?

PETER

    I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
    should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
    draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
    good quarrel, and the law on my side.

Nurse

    Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
    me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
    and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
    out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
    but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
    a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
    kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
    is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
    with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
    to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.

ROMEO

    Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
    protest unto thee--

Nurse

    Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
    Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.

ROMEO

    What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.

Nurse

    I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
    I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.

ROMEO

    Bid her devise
    Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
    And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
    Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.

Nurse

    No truly sir; not a penny.

ROMEO

    Go to; I say you shall.

Nurse

    This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.

ROMEO

    And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
    Within this hour my man shall be with thee
    And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
    Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
    Must be my convoy in the secret night.
    Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
    Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.

Nurse

    Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.

ROMEO

    What say'st thou, my dear nurse?

Nurse

    Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
    Two may keep counsel, putting one away?

ROMEO

    I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.

NURSE

    Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
    Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there
    is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
    lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief
    see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
    sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
    man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
    as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
    rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?

ROMEO

    Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.

Nurse

    Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
    the--No; I know it begins with some other
    letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of
    it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good
    to hear it.

ROMEO

    Commend me to thy lady.

Nurse

    Ay, a thousand times.

    Exit Romeo
    Peter!

PETER

    Anon!

Nurse

    Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.

    Enter JULIET 

JULIET

    The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
    In half an hour she promised to return.
    Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
    O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
    Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
    Driving back shadows over louring hills:
    Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
    And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
    Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
    Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
    Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
    Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
    She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
    My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
    And his to me:
    But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
    Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
    O God, she comes!

    Enter Nurse and PETER
    O honey nurse, what news?
    Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.

Nurse

    Peter, stay at the gate.

    Exit PETER

JULIET

    Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
    Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
    If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
    By playing it to me with so sour a face.

Nurse

    I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
    Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!

JULIET

    I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
    Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.

Nurse

    Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
    Do you not see that I am out of breath?

JULIET

    How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
    To say to me that thou art out of breath?
    The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
    Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
    Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
    Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
    Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?

Nurse

    Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
    how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
    face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
    all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
    though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
    past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
    but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
    ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?

JULIET

    No, no: but all this did I know before.
    What says he of our marriage? what of that?

Nurse

    Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
    It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
    My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
    Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
    To catch my death with jaunting up and down!

JULIET

    I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
    Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?

Nurse

    Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
    courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
    warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?

JULIET

    Where is my mother! why, she is within;
    Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
    'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
    Where is your mother?'

Nurse

    O God's lady dear!
    Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
    Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
    Henceforward do your messages yourself.

JULIET

    Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?

Nurse

    Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?

JULIET

    I have.

Nurse

    Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
    There stays a husband to make you a wife:
    Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
    They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
    Hie you to church; I must another way,
    To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
    Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
    I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
    But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
    Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.

JULIET

    Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.

    Exeunt

SCENE VI. Friar Laurence's cell.

    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and ROMEO 

FRIAR LAURENCE

    So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
    That after hours with sorrow chide us not!

ROMEO

    Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
    It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
    That one short minute gives me in her sight:
    Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
    Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
    It is enough I may but call her mine.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    These violent delights have violent ends
    And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
    Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
    Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
    And in the taste confounds the appetite:
    Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
    Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.

    Enter JULIET
    Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
    Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
    A lover may bestride the gossamer
    That idles in the wanton summer air,
    And yet not fall; so light is vanity.

JULIET

    Good even to my ghostly confessor.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.

JULIET

    As much to him, else is his thanks too much.

ROMEO

    Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
    Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
    To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
    This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
    Unfold the imagined happiness that both
    Receive in either by this dear encounter.

JULIET

    Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
    Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
    They are but beggars that can count their worth;
    But my true love is grown to such excess
    I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
    For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
    Till holy church incorporate two in one.

    Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. A public place.

    Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants 

BENVOLIO

    I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
    The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
    And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
    For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.

MERCUTIO

    Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
    enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
    upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
    thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
    it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.

BENVOLIO

    Am I like such a fellow?

MERCUTIO

    Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
    any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
    soon moody to be moved.

BENVOLIO

    And what to?

MERCUTIO

    Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
    shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
    thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
    or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
    wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
    other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
    eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
    Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
    meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
    an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
    man for coughing in the street, because he hath
    wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
    didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
    his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
    tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
    wilt tutor me from quarrelling!

BENVOLIO

    An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
    should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.

MERCUTIO

    The fee-simple! O simple!

BENVOLIO

    By my head, here come the Capulets.

MERCUTIO

    By my heel, I care not.

    Enter TYBALT and others

TYBALT

    Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
    Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.

MERCUTIO

    And but one word with one of us? couple it with
    something; make it a word and a blow.

TYBALT

    You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
    will give me occasion.

MERCUTIO

    Could you not take some occasion without giving?

TYBALT

    Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--

MERCUTIO

    Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
    thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
    discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
    make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!

BENVOLIO

    We talk here in the public haunt of men:
    Either withdraw unto some private place,
    And reason coldly of your grievances,
    Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.

MERCUTIO

    Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
    I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.

    Enter ROMEO

TYBALT

    Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.

MERCUTIO

    But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
    Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
    Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'

TYBALT

    Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
    No better term than this,--thou art a villain.

ROMEO

    Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
    Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
    To such a greeting: villain am I none;
    Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.

TYBALT

    Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
    That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.

ROMEO

    I do protest, I never injured thee,
    But love thee better than thou canst devise,
    Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
    And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
    As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.

MERCUTIO

    O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
    Alla stoccata carries it away.

    Draws
    Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?

TYBALT

    What wouldst thou have with me?

MERCUTIO

    Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
    lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
    shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
    eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
    by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
    ears ere it be out.

TYBALT

    I am for you.

    Drawing

ROMEO

    Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.

MERCUTIO

    Come, sir, your passado.

    They fight

ROMEO

    Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
    Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
    Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
    Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
    Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!

    TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies with his followers

MERCUTIO

    I am hurt.
    A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
    Is he gone, and hath nothing?

BENVOLIO

    What, art thou hurt?

MERCUTIO

    Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
    Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.

    Exit Page

ROMEO

    Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.

MERCUTIO

    No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
    church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
    me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
    am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
    both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
    cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
    rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
    arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
    was hurt under your arm.

ROMEO

    I thought all for the best.

MERCUTIO

    Help me into some house, Benvolio,
    Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
    They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
    And soundly too: your houses!

    Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO

ROMEO

    This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
    My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
    In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
    With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
    Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
    Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
    And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!

    Re-enter BENVOLIO

BENVOLIO

    O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
    That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
    Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.

ROMEO

    This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
    This but begins the woe, others must end.

BENVOLIO

    Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.

ROMEO

    Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
    Away to heaven, respective lenity,
    And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!

    Re-enter TYBALT
    Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
    That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
    Is but a little way above our heads,
    Staying for thine to keep him company:
    Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.

TYBALT

    Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
    Shalt with him hence.

ROMEO

    This shall determine that.

    They fight; TYBALT falls

BENVOLIO

    Romeo, away, be gone!
    The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
    Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
    If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!

ROMEO

    O, I am fortune's fool!

BENVOLIO

    Why dost thou stay?

    Exit ROMEO

    Enter Citizens, & c

First Citizen

    Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
    Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?

BENVOLIO

    There lies that Tybalt.

First Citizen

    Up, sir, go with me;
    I charge thee in the princes name, obey.

    Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their Wives, and others

PRINCE

    Where are the vile beginners of this fray?

BENVOLIO

    O noble prince, I can discover all
    The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
    There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
    That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.

LADY CAPULET

    Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
    O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
    O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
    For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
    O cousin, cousin!

PRINCE

    Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

BENVOLIO

    Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
    Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
    How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
    Your high displeasure: all this uttered
    With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
    Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
    Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
    With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
    Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
    And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
    Cold death aside, and with the other sends
    It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
    Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
    'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
    his tongue,
    His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
    And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
    An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
    Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
    But by and by comes back to Romeo,
    Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
    And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
    Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
    And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
    This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.

LADY CAPULET

    He is a kinsman to the Montague;
    Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
    Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
    And all those twenty could but kill one life.
    I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
    Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.

PRINCE

    Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
    Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?

MONTAGUE

    Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
    His fault concludes but what the law should end,
    The life of Tybalt.

PRINCE

    And for that offence
    Immediately we do exile him hence:
    I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
    My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
    But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
    That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
    I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
    Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
    Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
    Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
    Bear hence this body and attend our will:
    Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.

    Enter JULIET 

JULIET

    Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
    Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
    As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
    And bring in cloudy night immediately.
    Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
    That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
    Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
    Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
    By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
    It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
    Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
    And learn me how to lose a winning match,
    Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
    Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
    With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
    Think true love acted simple modesty.
    Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
    For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
    Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
    Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
    Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
    Take him and cut him out in little stars,
    And he will make the face of heaven so fine
    That all the world will be in love with night
    And pay no worship to the garish sun.
    O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
    But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
    Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
    As is the night before some festival
    To an impatient child that hath new robes
    And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
    And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
    But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.

    Enter Nurse, with cords
    Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
    That Romeo bid thee fetch?

Nurse

    Ay, ay, the cords.

    Throws them down

JULIET

    Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?

Nurse

    Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
    We are undone, lady, we are undone!
    Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!

JULIET

    Can heaven be so envious?

Nurse

    Romeo can,
    Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
    Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!

JULIET

    What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
    This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
    Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
    And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
    Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
    I am not I, if there be such an I;
    Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
    If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
    Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.

Nurse

    I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
    God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
    A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
    Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
    All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.

JULIET

    O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
    To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
    Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
    And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!

Nurse

    O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
    O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
    That ever I should live to see thee dead!

JULIET

    What storm is this that blows so contrary?
    Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
    My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
    Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
    For who is living, if those two are gone?

Nurse

    Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
    Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.

JULIET

    O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?

Nurse

    It did, it did; alas the day, it did!

JULIET

    O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
    Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
    Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
    Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
    Despised substance of divinest show!
    Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
    A damned saint, an honourable villain!
    O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
    When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
    In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
    Was ever book containing such vile matter
    So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
    In such a gorgeous palace!

Nurse

    There's no trust,
    No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
    All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
    Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
    These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
    Shame come to Romeo!

JULIET

    Blister'd be thy tongue
    For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
    Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
    For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
    Sole monarch of the universal earth.
    O, what a beast was I to chide at him!

Nurse

    Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?

JULIET

    Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
    Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
    When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
    But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
    That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
    Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
    Your tributary drops belong to woe,
    Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
    My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
    And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
    All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
    Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
    That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
    But, O, it presses to my memory,
    Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
    'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
    That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
    Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
    Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
    Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
    And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
    Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
    Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
    Which modern lamentations might have moved?
    But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
    'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
    Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
    All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
    There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
    In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
    Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?

Nurse

    Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
    Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.

JULIET

    Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
    When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
    Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
    Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
    He made you for a highway to my bed;
    But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
    Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
    And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!

Nurse

    Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
    To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
    Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
    I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.

JULIET

    O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
    And bid him come to take his last farewell.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.

    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE 

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
    Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
    And thou art wedded to calamity.

    Enter ROMEO

ROMEO

    Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
    What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
    That I yet know not?

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Too familiar
    Is my dear son with such sour company:
    I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.

ROMEO

    What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?

FRIAR LAURENCE

    A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
    Not body's death, but body's banishment.

ROMEO

    Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
    For exile hath more terror in his look,
    Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Hence from Verona art thou banished:
    Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.

ROMEO

    There is no world without Verona walls,
    But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
    Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
    And world's exile is death: then banished,
    Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
    Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
    And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
    Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
    Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
    And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
    This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.

ROMEO

    'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
    Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
    And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
    Live here in heaven and may look on her;
    But Romeo may not: more validity,
    More honourable state, more courtship lives
    In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
    On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
    And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
    Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
    Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
    But Romeo may not; he is banished:
    Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
    They are free men, but I am banished.
    And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
    Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
    No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
    But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
    O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
    Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
    Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
    A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
    To mangle me with that word 'banished'?

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.

ROMEO

    O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
    Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
    To comfort thee, though thou art banished.

ROMEO

    Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
    Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
    Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
    It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    O, then I see that madmen have no ears.

ROMEO

    How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.

ROMEO

    Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
    Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
    An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
    Doting like me and like me banished,
    Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
    And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
    Taking the measure of an unmade grave.

    Knocking within

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.

ROMEO

    Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
    Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.

    Knocking

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
    Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;

    Knocking
    Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
    What simpleness is this! I come, I come!

    Knocking
    Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?

Nurse

    [Within] Let me come in, and you shall know
    my errand;
    I come from Lady Juliet.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Welcome, then.

    Enter Nurse

Nurse

    O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
    Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?

FRIAR LAURENCE

    There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.

Nurse

    O, he is even in my mistress' case,
    Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
    Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
    Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
    Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
    For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
    Why should you fall into so deep an O?

ROMEO

    Nurse!

Nurse

    Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.

ROMEO

    Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
    Doth she not think me an old murderer,
    Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
    With blood removed but little from her own?
    Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
    My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?

Nurse

    O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
    And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
    And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
    And then down falls again.

ROMEO

    As if that name,
    Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
    Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
    Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
    In what vile part of this anatomy
    Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
    The hateful mansion.

    Drawing his sword

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Hold thy desperate hand:
    Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
    Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
    The unreasonable fury of a beast:
    Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
    Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
    Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
    I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
    Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
    And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
    By doing damned hate upon thyself?
    Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
    Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
    In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
    Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
    Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
    And usest none in that true use indeed
    Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
    Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
    Digressing from the valour of a man;
    Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
    Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
    Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
    Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
    Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
    Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
    And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
    What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
    For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
    There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
    But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
    The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
    And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
    A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
    Happiness courts thee in her best array;
    But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
    Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
    Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
    Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
    Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
    But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
    For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
    Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
    To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
    Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
    With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
    Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
    Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
    And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
    Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
    Romeo is coming.

Nurse

    O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
    To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
    My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.

ROMEO

    Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.

Nurse

    Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
    Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.

    Exit

ROMEO

    How well my comfort is revived by this!

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
    Either be gone before the watch be set,
    Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
    Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
    And he shall signify from time to time
    Every good hap to you that chances here:
    Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.

ROMEO

    But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
    It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. A room in Capulet's house.

    Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS 

CAPULET

    Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
    That we have had no time to move our daughter:
    Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
    And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
    'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
    I promise you, but for your company,
    I would have been a-bed an hour ago.

PARIS

    These times of woe afford no time to woo.
    Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.

LADY CAPULET

    I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
    To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.

CAPULET

    Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
    Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
    In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
    Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
    Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
    And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
    But, soft! what day is this?

PARIS

    Monday, my lord,

CAPULET

    Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
    O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
    She shall be married to this noble earl.
    Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
    We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
    For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
    It may be thought we held him carelessly,
    Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
    Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
    And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?

PARIS

    My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.

CAPULET

    Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
    Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
    Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
    Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
    Afore me! it is so very very late,
    That we may call it early by and by.
    Good night.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.

    Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window 

JULIET

    Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
    It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
    That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
    Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
    Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.

ROMEO

    It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
    No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
    Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
    Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
    Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
    I must be gone and live, or stay and die.

JULIET

    Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
    It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
    To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
    And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
    Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.

ROMEO

    Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
    I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
    I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
    'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
    Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
    The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
    I have more care to stay than will to go:
    Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
    How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.

JULIET

    It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
    It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
    Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
    Some say the lark makes sweet division;
    This doth not so, for she divideth us:
    Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
    O, now I would they had changed voices too!
    Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
    Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
    O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.

ROMEO

    More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!

    Enter Nurse, to the chamber

Nurse

    Madam!

JULIET

    Nurse?

Nurse

    Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
    The day is broke; be wary, look about.

    Exit

JULIET

    Then, window, let day in, and let life out.

ROMEO

    Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.

    He goeth down

JULIET

    Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
    I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
    For in a minute there are many days:
    O, by this count I shall be much in years
    Ere I again behold my Romeo!

ROMEO

    Farewell!
    I will omit no opportunity
    That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.

JULIET

    O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?

ROMEO

    I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
    For sweet discourses in our time to come.

JULIET

    O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
    Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
    As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
    Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.

ROMEO

    And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
    Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!

    Exit

JULIET

    O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
    If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
    That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
    For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
    But send him back.

LADY CAPULET

    [Within] Ho, daughter! are you up?

JULIET

    Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
    Is she not down so late, or up so early?
    What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?

    Enter LADY CAPULET

LADY CAPULET

    Why, how now, Juliet!

JULIET

    Madam, I am not well.

LADY CAPULET

    Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
    What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
    An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
    Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
    But much of grief shows still some want of wit.

JULIET

    Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.

LADY CAPULET

    So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
    Which you weep for.

JULIET

    Feeling so the loss,
    Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.

LADY CAPULET

    Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
    As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.

JULIET

    What villain madam?

LADY CAPULET

    That same villain, Romeo.

JULIET

    [Aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
    God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
    And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.

LADY CAPULET

    That is, because the traitor murderer lives.

JULIET

    Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
    Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!

LADY CAPULET

    We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
    Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
    Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
    Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
    That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
    And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.

JULIET

    Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
    With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
    Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
    Madam, if you could find out but a man
    To bear a poison, I would temper it;
    That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
    Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
    To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
    To wreak the love I bore my cousin
    Upon his body that slaughter'd him!

LADY CAPULET

    Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
    But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.

JULIET

    And joy comes well in such a needy time:
    What are they, I beseech your ladyship?

LADY CAPULET

    Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
    One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
    Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
    That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.

JULIET

    Madam, in happy time, what day is that?

LADY CAPULET

    Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
    The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
    The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
    Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.

JULIET

    Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
    He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
    I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
    Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
    I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
    I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
    It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
    Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!

LADY CAPULET

    Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
    And see how he will take it at your hands.

    Enter CAPULET and Nurse

CAPULET

    When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
    But for the sunset of my brother's son
    It rains downright.
    How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
    Evermore showering? In one little body
    Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
    For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
    Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
    Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
    Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
    Without a sudden calm, will overset
    Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
    Have you deliver'd to her our decree?

LADY CAPULET

    Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
    I would the fool were married to her grave!

CAPULET

    Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
    How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
    Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
    Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
    So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?

JULIET

    Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
    Proud can I never be of what I hate;
    But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.

CAPULET

    How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
    'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
    And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
    Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
    But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
    To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
    Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
    Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
    You tallow-face!

LADY CAPULET

    Fie, fie! what, are you mad?

JULIET

    Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
    Hear me with patience but to speak a word.

CAPULET

    Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
    I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
    Or never after look me in the face:
    Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
    My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
    That God had lent us but this only child;
    But now I see this one is one too much,
    And that we have a curse in having her:
    Out on her, hilding!

Nurse

    God in heaven bless her!
    You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.

CAPULET

    And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
    Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.

Nurse

    I speak no treason.

CAPULET

    O, God ye god-den.

Nurse

    May not one speak?

CAPULET

    Peace, you mumbling fool!
    Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
    For here we need it not.

LADY CAPULET

    You are too hot.

CAPULET

    God's bread! it makes me mad:
    Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
    Alone, in company, still my care hath been
    To have her match'd: and having now provided
    A gentleman of noble parentage,
    Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
    Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
    Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
    And then to have a wretched puling fool,
    A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
    To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
    I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
    But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
    Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
    Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
    Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
    An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
    And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
    the streets,
    For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
    Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
    Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.

    Exit

JULIET

    Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
    That sees into the bottom of my grief?
    O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
    Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
    Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
    In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.

LADY CAPULET

    Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
    Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.

    Exit

JULIET

    O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
    My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
    How shall that faith return again to earth,
    Unless that husband send it me from heaven
    By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
    Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
    Upon so soft a subject as myself!
    What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
    Some comfort, nurse.

Nurse

    Faith, here it is.
    Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
    That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
    Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
    Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
    I think it best you married with the county.
    O, he's a lovely gentleman!
    Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
    Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
    As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
    I think you are happy in this second match,
    For it excels your first: or if it did not,
    Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
    As living here and you no use of him.

JULIET

    Speakest thou from thy heart?

Nurse

    And from my soul too;
    Or else beshrew them both.

JULIET

    Amen!

Nurse

    What?

JULIET

    Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
    Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
    Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
    To make confession and to be absolved.

Nurse

    Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.

    Exit

JULIET

    Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
    Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
    Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
    Which she hath praised him with above compare
    So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
    Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
    I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
    If all else fail, myself have power to die.

    Exit

ACT IV
SCENE I. Friar Laurence's cell.

    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS 

FRIAR LAURENCE

    On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.

PARIS

    My father Capulet will have it so;
    And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    You say you do not know the lady's mind:
    Uneven is the course, I like it not.

PARIS

    Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
    And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
    For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
    Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
    That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
    And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
    To stop the inundation of her tears;
    Which, too much minded by herself alone,
    May be put from her by society:
    Now do you know the reason of this haste.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    [Aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
    Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.

    Enter JULIET

PARIS

    Happily met, my lady and my wife!

JULIET

    That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.

PARIS

    That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.

JULIET

    What must be shall be.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    That's a certain text.

PARIS

    Come you to make confession to this father?

JULIET

    To answer that, I should confess to you.

PARIS

    Do not deny to him that you love me.

JULIET

    I will confess to you that I love him.

PARIS

    So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.

JULIET

    If I do so, it will be of more price,
    Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.

PARIS

    Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.

JULIET

    The tears have got small victory by that;
    For it was bad enough before their spite.

PARIS

    Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.

JULIET

    That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
    And what I spake, I spake it to my face.

PARIS

    Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.

JULIET

    It may be so, for it is not mine own.
    Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
    Or shall I come to you at evening mass?

FRIAR LAURENCE

    My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
    My lord, we must entreat the time alone.

PARIS

    God shield I should disturb devotion!
    Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
    Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.

    Exit

JULIET

    O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
    Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
    It strains me past the compass of my wits:
    I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
    On Thursday next be married to this county.

JULIET

    Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
    Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
    If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
    Do thou but call my resolution wise,
    And with this knife I'll help it presently.
    God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
    And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
    Shall be the label to another deed,
    Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
    Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
    Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
    Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
    'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
    Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
    Which the commission of thy years and art
    Could to no issue of true honour bring.
    Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
    If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
    Which craves as desperate an execution.
    As that is desperate which we would prevent.
    If, rather than to marry County Paris,
    Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
    Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
    A thing like death to chide away this shame,
    That copest with death himself to scape from it:
    And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.

JULIET

    O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
    From off the battlements of yonder tower;
    Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
    Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
    Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
    O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
    With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
    Or bid me go into a new-made grave
    And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
    Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
    And I will do it without fear or doubt,
    To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
    To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
    To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
    Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
    Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
    And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
    When presently through all thy veins shall run
    A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
    Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
    No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
    The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
    To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
    Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
    Each part, deprived of supple government,
    Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
    And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
    Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
    And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
    Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
    To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
    Then, as the manner of our country is,
    In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
    Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
    Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
    In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
    Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
    And hither shall he come: and he and I
    Will watch thy waking, and that very night
    Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
    And this shall free thee from this present shame;
    If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
    Abate thy valour in the acting it.

JULIET

    Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
    In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
    To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.

JULIET

    Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
    Farewell, dear father!

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Hall in Capulet's house.

    Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, Nurse, and two Servingmen 

CAPULET

    So many guests invite as here are writ.

    Exit First Servant
    Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.

Second Servant

    You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
    can lick their fingers.

CAPULET

    How canst thou try them so?

Second Servant

    Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his
    own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his
    fingers goes not with me.

CAPULET

    Go, be gone.

    Exit Second Servant
    We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
    What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?

Nurse

    Ay, forsooth.

CAPULET

    Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
    A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.

Nurse

    See where she comes from shrift with merry look.

    Enter JULIET

CAPULET

    How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?

JULIET

    Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
    Of disobedient opposition
    To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
    By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
    And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
    Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.

CAPULET

    Send for the county; go tell him of this:
    I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.

JULIET

    I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
    And gave him what becomed love I might,
    Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.

CAPULET

    Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
    This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
    Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
    Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
    Our whole city is much bound to him.

JULIET

    Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
    To help me sort such needful ornaments
    As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?

LADY CAPULET

    No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.

CAPULET

    Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.

    Exeunt JULIET and Nurse

LADY CAPULET

    We shall be short in our provision:
    'Tis now near night.

CAPULET

    Tush, I will stir about,
    And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
    Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
    I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
    I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
    They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
    To County Paris, to prepare him up
    Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
    Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. Juliet's chamber.

    Enter JULIET and Nurse 

JULIET

    Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
    I pray thee, leave me to my self to-night,
    For I have need of many orisons
    To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
    Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.

    Enter LADY CAPULET

LADY CAPULET

    What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?

JULIET

    No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
    As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
    So please you, let me now be left alone,
    And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
    For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
    In this so sudden business.

LADY CAPULET

    Good night:
    Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.

    Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse

JULIET

    Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
    I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
    That almost freezes up the heat of life:
    I'll call them back again to comfort me:
    Nurse! What should she do here?
    My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
    Come, vial.
    What if this mixture do not work at all?
    Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
    No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.

    Laying down her dagger
    What if it be a poison, which the friar
    Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
    Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
    Because he married me before to Romeo?
    I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
    For he hath still been tried a holy man.
    How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
    I wake before the time that Romeo
    Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
    Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
    To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
    And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
    Or, if I live, is it not very like,
    The horrible conceit of death and night,
    Together with the terror of the place,--
    As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
    Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
    Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
    Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
    Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
    At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
    Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
    So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
    And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
    That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
    O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
    Environed with all these hideous fears?
    And madly play with my forefather's joints?
    And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
    And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
    As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
    O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
    Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
    Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
    Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.

    She falls upon her bed, within the curtains

SCENE IV. Hall in Capulet's house.

    Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse 

LADY CAPULET

    Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.

Nurse

    They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.

    Enter CAPULET

CAPULET

    Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
    The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
    Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:
    Spare not for the cost.

Nurse

    Go, you cot-quean, go,
    Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
    For this night's watching.

CAPULET

    No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
    All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.

LADY CAPULET

    Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
    But I will watch you from such watching now.

    Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse

CAPULET

    A jealous hood, a jealous hood!

    Enter three or four Servingmen, with spits, logs, and baskets
    Now, fellow,
    What's there?

First Servant

    Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.

CAPULET

    Make haste, make haste.

    Exit First Servant
    Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
    Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.

Second Servant

    I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,
    And never trouble Peter for the matter.

    Exit

CAPULET

    Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
    Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:
    The county will be here with music straight,
    For so he said he would: I hear him near.

    Music within
    Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!

    Re-enter Nurse
    Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;
    I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,
    Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:
    Make haste, I say.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Juliet's chamber.

    Enter Nurse 

Nurse

    Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she:
    Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
    Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
    What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
    Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
    The County Paris hath set up his rest,
    That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
    Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
    I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
    Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
    He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?

    Undraws the curtains
    What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
    I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady!
    Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead!
    O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
    Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!

    Enter LADY CAPULET

LADY CAPULET

    What noise is here?

Nurse

    O lamentable day!

LADY CAPULET

    What is the matter?

Nurse

    Look, look! O heavy day!

LADY CAPULET

    O me, O me! My child, my only life,
    Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
    Help, help! Call help.

    Enter CAPULET

CAPULET

    For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.

Nurse

    She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!

LADY CAPULET

    Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!

CAPULET

    Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
    Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
    Life and these lips have long been separated:
    Death lies on her like an untimely frost
    Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.

Nurse

    O lamentable day!

LADY CAPULET

    O woful time!

CAPULET

    Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
    Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.

    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS, with Musicians

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Come, is the bride ready to go to church?

CAPULET

    Ready to go, but never to return.
    O son! the night before thy wedding-day
    Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
    Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
    Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
    My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
    And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.

PARIS

    Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
    And doth it give me such a sight as this?

LADY CAPULET

    Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
    Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
    In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
    But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
    But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
    And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!

Nurse

    O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
    Most lamentable day, most woful day,
    That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
    O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
    Never was seen so black a day as this:
    O woful day, O woful day!

PARIS

    Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
    Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
    By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
    O love! O life! not life, but love in death!

CAPULET

    Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
    Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
    To murder, murder our solemnity?
    O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
    Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
    And with my child my joys are buried.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
    In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
    Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
    And all the better is it for the maid:
    Your part in her you could not keep from death,
    But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
    The most you sought was her promotion;
    For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
    And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
    Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
    O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
    That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
    She's not well married that lives married long;
    But she's best married that dies married young.
    Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
    On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
    In all her best array bear her to church:
    For though fond nature bids us an lament,
    Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.

CAPULET

    All things that we ordained festival,
    Turn from their office to black funeral;
    Our instruments to melancholy bells,
    Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
    Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
    Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
    And all things change them to the contrary.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
    And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
    To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
    The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
    Move them no more by crossing their high will.

    Exeunt CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, PARIS, and FRIAR LAURENCE

First Musician

    Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.

Nurse

    Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
    For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.

    Exit

First Musician

    Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.

    Enter PETER

PETER

    Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's
    ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'

First Musician

    Why 'Heart's ease?'

PETER

    O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
    heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,
    to comfort me.

First Musician

    Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.

PETER

    You will not, then?

First Musician

    No.

PETER

    I will then give it you soundly.

First Musician

    What will you give us?

PETER

    No money, on my faith, but the gleek;
    I will give you the minstrel.

First Musician

    Then I will give you the serving-creature.

PETER

    Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
    your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,
    I'll fa you; do you note me?

First Musician

    An you re us and fa us, you note us.

Second Musician

    Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.

PETER

    Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
    with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer
    me like men:
    'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
    And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
    Then music with her silver sound'--
    why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver
    sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?

Musician

    Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.

PETER

    Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?

Second Musician

    I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.

PETER

    Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?

Third Musician

    Faith, I know not what to say.

PETER

    O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say
    for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'
    because musicians have no gold for sounding:
    'Then music with her silver sound
    With speedy help doth lend redress.'

    Exit

First Musician

    What a pestilent knave is this same!

Second Musician

    Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the
    mourners, and stay dinner.

    Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. Mantua. A street.

    Enter ROMEO 

ROMEO

    If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
    My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
    My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
    And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
    Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
    I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
    Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
    to think!--
    And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
    That I revived, and was an emperor.
    Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
    When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!

    Enter BALTHASAR, booted
    News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
    Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
    How doth my lady? Is my father well?
    How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
    For nothing can be ill, if she be well.

BALTHASAR

    Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
    Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
    And her immortal part with angels lives.
    I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
    And presently took post to tell it you:
    O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
    Since you did leave it for my office, sir.

ROMEO

    Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
    Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
    And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.

BALTHASAR

    I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
    Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
    Some misadventure.

ROMEO

    Tush, thou art deceived:
    Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
    Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?

BALTHASAR

    No, my good lord.

ROMEO

    No matter: get thee gone,
    And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.

    Exit BALTHASAR
    Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
    Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
    To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
    I do remember an apothecary,--
    And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
    In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
    Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
    Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
    And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
    An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
    Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
    A beggarly account of empty boxes,
    Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
    Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
    Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
    Noting this penury, to myself I said
    'An if a man did need a poison now,
    Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
    Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
    O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
    And this same needy man must sell it me.
    As I remember, this should be the house.
    Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
    What, ho! apothecary!

    Enter Apothecary

Apothecary

    Who calls so loud?

ROMEO

    Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
    Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
    A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
    As will disperse itself through all the veins
    That the life-weary taker may fall dead
    And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
    As violently as hasty powder fired
    Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.

Apothecary

    Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
    Is death to any he that utters them.

ROMEO

    Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
    And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
    Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
    Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
    The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
    The world affords no law to make thee rich;
    Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.

Apothecary

    My poverty, but not my will, consents.

ROMEO

    I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.

Apothecary

    Put this in any liquid thing you will,
    And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
    Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.

ROMEO

    There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
    Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
    Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
    I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
    Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
    Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
    To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Friar Laurence's cell.

    Enter FRIAR JOHN 

FRIAR JOHN

    Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!

    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE

FRIAR LAURENCE

    This same should be the voice of Friar John.
    Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
    Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.

FRIAR JOHN

    Going to find a bare-foot brother out
    One of our order, to associate me,
    Here in this city visiting the sick,
    And finding him, the searchers of the town,
    Suspecting that we both were in a house
    Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
    Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
    So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?

FRIAR JOHN

    I could not send it,--here it is again,--
    Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
    So fearful were they of infection.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
    The letter was not nice but full of charge
    Of dear import, and the neglecting it
    May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
    Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
    Unto my cell.

FRIAR JOHN

    Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.

    Exit

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Now must I to the monument alone;
    Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
    She will beshrew me much that Romeo
    Hath had no notice of these accidents;
    But I will write again to Mantua,
    And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
    Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!

    Exit

SCENE III. A churchyard; in it a tomb belonging to the Capulets.

    Enter PARIS, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch 

PARIS

    Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
    Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
    Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
    Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
    So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
    Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
    But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
    As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
    Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.

PAGE

    [Aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone
    Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.

    Retires

PARIS

    Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
    O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
    Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
    Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
    The obsequies that I for thee will keep
    Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.

    The Page whistles
    The boy gives warning something doth approach.
    What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
    To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
    What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.

    Retires

    Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR, with a torch, mattock, & c

ROMEO

    Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
    Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
    See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
    Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
    Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
    And do not interrupt me in my course.
    Why I descend into this bed of death,
    Is partly to behold my lady's face;
    But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
    A precious ring, a ring that I must use
    In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
    But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
    In what I further shall intend to do,
    By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
    And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
    The time and my intents are savage-wild,
    More fierce and more inexorable far
    Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.

BALTHASAR

    I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.

ROMEO

    So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
    Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.

BALTHASAR

    [Aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:
    His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.

    Retires

ROMEO

    Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
    Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
    Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
    And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!

    Opens the tomb

PARIS

    This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
    That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
    It is supposed, the fair creature died;
    And here is come to do some villanous shame
    To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.

    Comes forward
    Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
    Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
    Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
    Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.

ROMEO

    I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
    Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
    Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;
    Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
    Put not another sin upon my head,
    By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
    By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
    For I come hither arm'd against myself:
    Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
    A madman's mercy bade thee run away.

PARIS

    I do defy thy conjurations,
    And apprehend thee for a felon here.

ROMEO

    Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!

    They fight

PAGE

    O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.

    Exit

PARIS

    O, I am slain!

    Falls
    If thou be merciful,
    Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.

    Dies

ROMEO

    In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
    Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
    What said my man, when my betossed soul
    Did not attend him as we rode? I think
    He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
    Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
    Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
    To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
    One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
    I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
    A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
    For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
    This vault a feasting presence full of light.
    Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.

    Laying PARIS in the tomb
    How oft when men are at the point of death
    Have they been merry! which their keepers call
    A lightning before death: O, how may I
    Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
    Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
    Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
    Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
    Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
    And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
    Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
    O, what more favour can I do to thee,
    Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
    To sunder his that was thine enemy?
    Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
    Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
    That unsubstantial death is amorous,
    And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
    Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
    For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
    And never from this palace of dim night
    Depart again: here, here will I remain
    With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
    Will I set up my everlasting rest,
    And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
    From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
    Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
    The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
    A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
    Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
    Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
    The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
    Here's to my love!

    Drinks
    O true apothecary!
    Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.

    Dies

    Enter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR LAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spade

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
    Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?

BALTHASAR

    Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
    What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
    To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
    It burneth in the Capel's monument.

BALTHASAR

    It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
    One that you love.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Who is it?

BALTHASAR

    Romeo.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    How long hath he been there?

BALTHASAR

    Full half an hour.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Go with me to the vault.

BALTHASAR

    I dare not, sir
    My master knows not but I am gone hence;
    And fearfully did menace me with death,
    If I did stay to look on his intents.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
    O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.

BALTHASAR

    As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
    I dreamt my master and another fought,
    And that my master slew him.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Romeo!

    Advances
    Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
    The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
    What mean these masterless and gory swords
    To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?

    Enters the tomb
    Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
    And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
    Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
    The lady stirs.

    JULIET wakes

JULIET

    O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
    I do remember well where I should be,
    And there I am. Where is my Romeo?

    Noise within

FRIAR LAURENCE

    I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
    Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
    A greater power than we can contradict
    Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
    Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
    And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
    Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
    Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
    Come, go, good Juliet,

    Noise again
    I dare no longer stay.

JULIET

    Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.

    Exit FRIAR LAURENCE
    What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
    Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
    O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
    To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
    Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
    To make die with a restorative.

    Kisses him
    Thy lips are warm.

First Watchman

    [Within] Lead, boy: which way?

JULIET

    Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!

    Snatching ROMEO's dagger
    This is thy sheath;

    Stabs herself
    there rust, and let me die.

    Falls on ROMEO's body, and dies

    Enter Watch, with the Page of PARIS

PAGE

    This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.

First Watchman

    The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
    Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
    Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
    And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
    Who here hath lain these two days buried.
    Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
    Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
    We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
    But the true ground of all these piteous woes
    We cannot without circumstance descry.

    Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR

Second Watchman

    Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.

First Watchman

    Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.

    Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE

Third Watchman

    Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
    We took this mattock and this spade from him,
    As he was coming from this churchyard side.

First Watchman

    A great suspicion: stay the friar too.

    Enter the PRINCE and Attendants

PRINCE

    What misadventure is so early up,
    That calls our person from our morning's rest?

    Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others

CAPULET

    What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?

LADY CAPULET

    The people in the street cry Romeo,
    Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
    With open outcry toward our monument.

PRINCE

    What fear is this which startles in our ears?

First Watchman

    Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
    And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
    Warm and new kill'd.

PRINCE

    Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.

First Watchman

    Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
    With instruments upon them, fit to open
    These dead men's tombs.

CAPULET

    O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
    This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
    Is empty on the back of Montague,--
    And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!

LADY CAPULET

    O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
    That warns my old age to a sepulchre.

    Enter MONTAGUE and others

PRINCE

    Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
    To see thy son and heir more early down.

MONTAGUE

    Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
    Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
    What further woe conspires against mine age?

PRINCE

    Look, and thou shalt see.

MONTAGUE

    O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
    To press before thy father to a grave?

PRINCE

    Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
    Till we can clear these ambiguities,
    And know their spring, their head, their
    true descent;
    And then will I be general of your woes,
    And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
    And let mischance be slave to patience.
    Bring forth the parties of suspicion.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    I am the greatest, able to do least,
    Yet most suspected, as the time and place
    Doth make against me of this direful murder;
    And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
    Myself condemned and myself excused.

PRINCE

    Then say at once what thou dost know in this.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    I will be brief, for my short date of breath
    Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
    Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
    And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
    I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
    Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
    Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
    For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
    You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
    Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
    To County Paris: then comes she to me,
    And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
    To rid her from this second marriage,
    Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
    Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
    A sleeping potion; which so took effect
    As I intended, for it wrought on her
    The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
    That he should hither come as this dire night,
    To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
    Being the time the potion's force should cease.
    But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
    Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
    Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
    At the prefixed hour of her waking,
    Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
    Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
    But when I came, some minute ere the time
    Of her awaking, here untimely lay
    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
    She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
    And bear this work of heaven with patience:
    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
    And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
    But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
    All this I know; and to the marriage
    Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
    Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
    Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
    Unto the rigour of severest law.

PRINCE

    We still have known thee for a holy man.
    Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?

BALTHASAR

    I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
    And then in post he came from Mantua
    To this same place, to this same monument.
    This letter he early bid me give his father,
    And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
    I departed not and left him there.

PRINCE

    Give me the letter; I will look on it.
    Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
    Sirrah, what made your master in this place?

PAGE

    He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
    And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
    Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
    And by and by my master drew on him;
    And then I ran away to call the watch.

PRINCE

    This letter doth make good the friar's words,
    Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
    And here he writes that he did buy a poison
    Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
    Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
    Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
    See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
    That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
    And I for winking at your discords too
    Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.

CAPULET

    O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
    This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
    Can I demand.

MONTAGUE

    But I can give thee more:
    For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
    That while Verona by that name is known,
    There shall no figure at such rate be set
    As that of true and faithful Juliet.

CAPULET

    As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
    Poor sacrifices of our enmity!

PRINCE

    A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
    The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
    Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
    Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
    For never was a story of more woe
    Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

    Exeunt
